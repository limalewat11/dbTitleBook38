Understanding what lay behind these events, the rise of &#x201c;fictitious capital&#x201d; and its opaque logic, is crucial to grasping the social and political conditions under which we live. Yet, for most people, the operations of the financial system remain shrouded in mystery.<br><br>In this lucid and compelling book, economist C�dric Durand offers a concise and critical introduction to the world of finance, unveiling the truth behind the credit crunch. <i>Fictitious Capital</i> moves beyond moralizing tales about greedy bankers, short-sighted experts and compromised regulators to look at the big picture. Using comparative data covering the last four decades, Durand examines the relationship between trends such as the rise in private and public debt and the proliferation of financial products; norms such as our habitual assumptions about the production of value and financial stability; and the relationship of all this to political power.<br><br><i>Fictitious Capital</i> offers a stark warning about the direction that the international economy is taking. Durand argues that the accelerated expansion of financial operations is a sign of the declining power of the economies of the Global North. The City, Wall Street and other centres of the power of money, he suggests, may already be caked with the frosts of winter.</p><p><b>C�dric Durand</b> teaches Economics and Development Theories at the University of Paris 13 and the EHESS. Working within the tradition of Marxist and French Regulationist political economy, he is the author of several articles on the euro&#x2013;crisis, the financialization-globalization nexus and the post-Soviet transformation. He is a member of the editorial board of the radical online journal <i>ContreTemps</i>.&#x201c;C�dric Durand is among the most promising of young French university economists today. We awaited the publication of his new book with bated breath. It was worth the wait. <i>Fictitious Capital</i> is an important intervention which tries to make sense of the excesses of capitalism over the last forty years and of the development of finance.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;Jacques Sapir</b><br><br> &#x201c;Durand has provided a very insightful view of finance-driven capitalism over the last three decades. Why was it able to prosper alongside sagging investment and plummeting productivity gains? The answer, argues Durand, lies in the tight connection between the shareholder value principle and the globalization of the real economy.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;Michel Aglietta</b><br><br> &#x201c;<i>Fictitious Capital</i> is a fascinating and extremely informative exploration of the destructive role of finance in our contemporary political economy. Filled with brilliant insights and an impressive historical and theoretical reach, Durand explains and utilizes Marx's concept of &#x2018;fictitious capital&#x2019; to illuminate the inner workings of contemporary global capitalism and to pierce the murky veil that mainstream economics and neo-liberal thought has long used to hide and distort the powerful role of finance. Students trying to understand the precarious political and economic position in which we find ourselves, as well as the theoretical foundations for understanding this, will learn much from this well-written, data rich, and theoretically clear exposition. If you read this terrific book, you will come away well-armed for the struggle ahead.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;Gerald Epstein</b></p><h2>Raising Godly Tomatoes</h2><p><i><b>Weary of struggling with your toddler?</b> Frustrated with the failing advice of secular psychologists and permissive parenting gurus?

In his dream there was no earth, only a dark, empty sky, and beyond the sky, unimaginably vast, the crystalline firmament in which the stars shone brightly. No clouds obscured the stars, and yet there was lightning in the dream, lightning without thunder, random flashes of blinding light that illuminated great flocks of birds that suddenly filled the dark sky. There were vultures and eagles, ravens and crows, every sort of bird imaginable, soaring and flapping their wings, yet making no more sound than the silent lightning. The dream had filled him with a sense of urgency and confusion.<br>Awake now, Lucius heard a faint rumble of thunder in the distance.<br>He heard other sounds from elsewhere in the house. The slaves were up and beginning to stir, stoking the kitchen fire and opening shutters.<br>Lucius jumped from his bed. His room, with a small balcony looking west, was on the upper floor of the house. Below him was the slope of the Aventine Hill. The nearer houses, along the crest of the hill, were large and well made, like his family&#x2019;s house. Farther down the hill, humbler houses and tenements and artisans&#x2019; workshops were crowded close together, and farther yet was a flat expanse with large granaries and ware houses close to the Tiber. At the river the city ended. On the far side of the Tiber, woods and meadows were divided into the private estates of the rich, which extended to the far horizon of hills and mountains.<br>How his mother hated this view! Born into a wealthy branch of the Cornelius family, she had grown up in a house on the other, more fashionable side of the Aventine Hill, with a view of the vast Circus Maximus below, the Capitoline Hill crowned by temples off to one side, and, directly opposite, the opulent Palatine Hill, where the emperor lived. &#x201c;Why, from our rooftop, when I was a girl,&#x201d; she would say, &#x201c;I could see the smoke from sacrifices on the Capitoline, watch the chariot races below, and even catch a glimpse of the emperor himself, strolling on one of his terraces across the way.&#x201d; (&#x201c;All at the same time, Camilla?&#x201d; Lucius&#x2019;s father would say, gently mocking her.) But this was the view Lucius had grown up with. For twenty-four years this had been the Roma seen from his room, a jumble of the rich and poor&#x2014;mostly the poor&#x2014;where slaves labored endlessly in vast store houses to accommodate all the goods and grain that arrived day after day, carried up the river from the great world beyond, the world that belonged to Roma.<br>The month of Maius had been overcast and rainy so far, and this day promised to be no different. By the dim light of dawn beneath an overcast sky, Lucius saw the towering cypress trees along the Tiber sway this way and that. The blustering winds were warm and carried the smell of rain. In the far distance, black storm clouds roiled on the horizon, bristling with lighting.<br>&#x201c;Perfect weather for an augury!&#x201d; whispered Lucius.<br>His room was sparsely furnished with a narrow bed and a single backless chair, a small pigeonhole bookcase filled with scrolls left over from his childhood education, a mirror on a stand made of burnished copper, and a few trunks to accommodate his clothing. He opened the most ornate of the trunks and carefully removed the special garment it contained.<br>Ordinarily, he would have waited for a slave to help him dress&#x2014;arranging the folds correctly was a complicated task&#x2014;but Lucius could not wait. The garment was not simply a toga, such as the one he had put on when he became a man at the age of seventeen. It was a trabea, the special garment worn only by augurs, the members of the ancient priesthood trained to divine the will of the gods. It was not white but saffron with broad purple stripes. Except for the fitting, when the tailor had made it for him, this was the first time Lucius had even touched the trabea. The never-worn wool was soft and thick and had a fresh smell of murex dye.<br>He put on the garment and did his best to pull the hanging folds into a proper arrangement. He glanced at himself in the copper mirror, then reached into the trunk again. He picked up a slender ivory wand that ended in a little spiral. The lituus was a family heirloom and a familiar friend; Lucius had spent countless hours practicing with it in preparation for this day. But now he looked at the lituus with fresh eyes, studying the intricate carvings that decorated every part of its surface with images of ravens, crows, owls, eagles, vultures, and chickens, as well as foxes, wolves, horses, and dogs&#x2014;all the various creatures from whose actions a trained augur could interpret the will of the gods.<br>He left his room and descended the stairs, crossed the garden surrounded by a peristyle at the center of the house, and stepped into the dining room, where his mother and father reclinined together on a couch while a slave served their breakfast.<br>His mother was wearing a simple stola, with her long hair not yet combed and pinned for the day. She leaped up from her couch. &#x201c;Lucius! What are you doing dressed in your trabea already? You can&#x2019;t eat breakfast wearing that! What if you get food on it? The ceremony is hours away. We&#x2019;ll be going to the baths first. The barber must shave you and your father&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>Lucius laughed. &#x201c;Mother, I did it on a whim. Of course I won&#x2019;t wear it to breakfast. But what do you think?&#x201d;<br>Camilla sighed. &#x201c;You look splendid, Lucius. Absolutely splendid! As handsome as ever your father was in his trabea. Don&#x2019;t you think so, dear?&#x201d;<br>Lucius&#x2019;s father, who strove always to maintain the restraint proper to a man of his standing&#x2014;a patrician, a senator, and a cousin of the emperor&#x2014;merely nodded. &#x201c;Handsome our boy certainly is. But looking pretty is not the point when a man puts on his trabea. A priest must carry his garment as he carries his lituus, with dignity and authority, as befits the intermediary of the gods.&#x201d;<br>Lucius drew back his shoulders, raised his chin, and held forth his lituus. &#x201c;What do you think, father? Do I look properly dignified?&#x201d;<br>The elder Lucius Pinarius looked at his son and raised an eyebrow. To him, young Lucius often still looked like a boy, and never more so than at this moment, dressed up in priestly finery but with the folds of his trabea tucked and draped haphazardly, like a child in grown-up costume. Twenty-four was very young for a man to be inducted into the college of augurs. The elder Pinarius had been in his forties before the honor came to him. With his black hair mussed from sleeping, his broad smile, and his smoothly handsome features, young Lucius hardly fit the standard image of the wrinkled, gray-haired augur. Still, the young man came from a long line of augurs, and he had shown great aptitude in his studies.<br>&#x201c;You look very fine, my son. Now, go change into a nice tunic. We shall have a bite to eat, then be off to the baths for a wash and a shave, then hurry back home to get ready for the ceremony. Hopefully, the storm will hold off and we won&#x2019;t be drenched with rain.&#x201d;<br>Having a slave arrange the trabea certainly made a difference, Lucius had to admit, as he studied himself in the copper mirror later that day. The sight of himself freshly groomed and properly outfitted in his trabea filled him with confidence. Of course, he was not an augur quite yet. Preceding the induction ceremony there would be a final examination in which Lucius would be called upon to demonstrate his skills. Lucius frowned. He was a little nervous about the examination.<br>This time, when he descended from his room, his mother almost swooned at the sight of him. His father, now dressed in his own trabea and carrying his own lituus, gave him a warm smile of approval.<br>&#x201c;Shall we be off, father?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not quite yet. You have a visitor.&#x201d;<br>Across the garden, a young man and a girl were seated on a bench beneath the peristyle.<br>&#x201c;Acilia!&#x201d; Lucius began to run to her, then slowed his pace. A trabea was not made for running, and it would not do to catch the soft wool on a thorn as he passed the rose bushes.<br>Acilia&#x2019;s older brother rose to his feet, nodded curtly, and discreetly withdrew. Looking over his shoulder, Lucius saw that his parents had also disappeared, to allow him a moment of privacy with his betrothed.<br>Lucius took her hands in his. &#x201c;Acilia, you look beautiful today.&#x201d; It was true. Her honey-colored hair was worn long and straight, as befitted an unmarried girl. Her eyes were bright blue. Her cheeks were as smooth as rose petals. Her petite body was largely hidden by her modest, long-sleeved tunica, but during the year that they had been betrothed she had definitely begun to acquire the contours of a woman&#x2019;s body. She was ten years younger than Lucius.<br>&#x201c;Look at you, Lucius&#x2014;so handsome in your trabea!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what my mother said.&#x201d; As they strolled across the garden, he suddenly felt self-conscious about their surroundings. Lucius was acutely aware that the house of Acilia&#x2019;s father was far grander than that of the Pinarii, more lavishly furnished, tended by more house hold slaves, and located on the more fashionable side of the Aventine Hill, near the Temple of Diana. The Acilii were plebeians, descended from a family far less ancient than the patrician Pinarii, but the Acilii had a great deal of money, while the fortunes of the Pinarii had dwindled in recent years. Lucius&#x2019;s late grandfather had owned a fine mansion on the Palatine, but his debts had forced the family to move to their current accommodations. To be sure, the vestibule of their house contained the wax masks of many venerable ancestors, but that was not the sort of thing to impress a girl. Had Acilia noticed how overgrown and untended the garden was? Lucius remembered the perfectly trimmed hedges and topiaries, the marble walkways and expensive pieces of bronze statuary in the garden at Acilia&#x2019;s house. The roof of the peristyle behind Acilia was missing more than a few tiles, and the wall was unsightly with peeling plaster and water stains. The slave who was supposed to tend the garden was already overworked with other duties, and there was no money to repair the roof or the wall.<br>Lack of money: that was the reason they were not yet married. Acilia&#x2019;s father, after the initial excitement of betrothing his daughter to the patrician son of a senator and a cousin of the emperor, had since found one excuse after another to postpone setting a date for the ceremony. Obviously, having discovered more about the Pinarii&#x2019;s finances, Titus Acilius had grown dubious about Lucius&#x2019;s prospects in the world. From the moment Lucius first saw her, at a meeting arranged by their fathers, Lucius had liked Acilia; since then he had fallen hopelessly in love with her, and she seemed to feel the same. But that counted for nothing unless her father could be swayed to approve the union.<br>Acilia said nothing about the state of the garden or the unsightly wall. She gazed admiringly at the lituus he carried.<br>&#x201c;Such ornate carvings! What is it made of?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ivory.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;From the tusk of an elephant?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So they say.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s very beautiful.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s been in the family a long time. You can tell the ivory is very old, because of the color. Many generations of Pinarii have been augurs, taking auspices at state ceremonies, on battlefields, at temple dedications. And at private events, as well, like ... weddings.&#x201d;<br>Acilia seemed duly impressed. &#x201c;And only men from the ancient patrician families can become augurs?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201d; And I can give you a patrician son, he thought. Yet even as he basked in her admiration, he heard a scurrying noise and looked up to see a rat running along the roof of the peristyle behind her. With a flick of its long tail, the rat dislodged a loose tile. Hearing Lucius gasp, Acilia look around just in time to see the tile fall and shatter on a paving stone. She jumped and uttered a little cry. Had she seen the rat?<br>To distract her, he seized her shoulder, spun her around to face him, and kissed her. It was only a quick kiss, but still she looked astonished.<br>&#x201c;Lucius, what if my brother should see?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;See what? This?&#x201d;<br>He kissed her again, not as quickly.<br>She drew back, blushing but looking pleased. Directly in front of her was the amulet on the necklace that Lucius was wearing. It had slipped from inside his trabea and lay nestled amid the saffron-and-purple folds.<br>&#x201c;Is that part of your augur&#x2019;s outfit?&#x201d; she said.<br>&#x201c;No. It&#x2019;s a family heirloom. My grandfather gave it to me when I ten years old. I wear it only on special occasions.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;May I touch it?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;<br>She reached up to touch the little lump of gold, which was vaguely cruciform in shape.<br>&#x201c;I remember the day my grandfather gave it to me. He showed me the proper way to wear a toga, and then took me all around the city, just the two of us. He showed me the exact spot where his great-uncle, Julius Caesar, was murdered. He showed me the Great Altar of Hercules, the most ancient shrine in the city, which was erected by the Pinarius family in the days before Roma even existed. He showed me the fig tree on the Palatine where Romulus and Remus and their friend Pinarius climbed among the branches. And finally he showed me the Temple of Venus that Caesar built, and that was the first time I saw the fantastic golden statue of Cleopatra inside. My grandfather knew Cleopatra very well, and he knew Marcus Antonius, too. Someday ... someday I want to have a son, and take him to see all those things, and tell him about his ancestors.&#x201d;<br>Acilia still held the amulet. As he spoke, she had drawn closer to him, until her body pressed gently against his. She gazed at the amulet, then looked up into his eyes.<br>&#x201c;But what sort of amulet is this? I can&#x2019;t make out the shape.&#x201d;<br>Lucius shook his head. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s funny, my grandfather made such a fuss about giving it to me, but even he wasn&#x2019;t sure what it&#x2019;s supposed to represent or where it came from. He only knew that it had been in the family for many generations. The original shape must have worn away over so many lifetimes.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing like that in our family,&#x201d; said Acilia, clearly impressed. She was so close that Lucius felt an urge to put his arms around her and hold her tightly against him, no matter that her brother might appear at any moment. But the sky above them suddenly opened and pelted the garden with rain. The raindrops were warm, and Lucius would have been happy to stand there, holding her, both of them getting soaking wet, but Acilia dropped the amulet, seized his hand, and with a shriek of laughter pulled him through the peristyle and into the house.<br>They found Lucius&#x2019;s father and Acilia&#x2019;s brother sitting next to each other in a pair of matching ebony chairs with inlays of lapis and abalone. It was no accident that his father had guided their guest to the best two pieces of furniture in the house.<br>Marcus Acilius was only a few years older than his sister and had the same golden hair and bright blue eyes. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s been five years since the disaster that took place in the Teutoberg Forest,&#x201d; he was saying, &#x201c;and still nothing has been done to settle the score with the Germanic tribes. They&#x2019;re laughing at us. It&#x2019;s a scandal!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So, the rain has driven you inside.&#x201d; Lucius&#x2019;s father looked up at the couple and smiled warmly at Acilia. He wanted the marriage to take place as badly as Lucius did. &#x201c;Marcus and I have been talking about the situation in the north.&#x201d; He turned his attention back to Acilia&#x2019;s brother.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a young man, Marcus. Five years seems to you a very long time. But in the grand scheme of things, it&#x2019;s no more than the blink of an eye. This city was not built in a day, nor was the empire conquered in a lifetime. To be sure, for a long time, Roma seemed unstoppable. Ever outward our legions pushed the limits of the empire, and all obstacles fell befor...</p><h2>The Complete Book of Butchering, Smoking, Curing, and Sausage Making: How to Harvest Your Livestock &amp; Wild Game (Complete Meat)</h2><p><p>Here&#x2019;s the ideal hands-on guidebook for self-sufficient farmers, ranchers, and hunters with step-by-step instructions on butchering beef, venison, pork, lamb, poultry, and goats.

Visit&nbsp;her online at&nbsp;www.bethkrommes.com.</p>Starred Review. Grade 1-4&#x2013;In her introduction to this collection of magical tales, Lunge-Larsen traces the history of those "beings whose presence we feel but whom we cannot see." She explains that, like humans, "Some are kind and gentle; some are quick to anger and resentment," but all are hidden away. They are most likely to show themselves during "in-between" times, appearing at Midsummer Night's Eve or the winter solstice, or during the transitions from dusk to night and from dawn to day. Focusing on tales from northern Europe, the book is divided into sections on flower fairies, gnomes, hill folk, elves, dwarves, water horses, river sprites, and selkies. Each chapter begins with an overview and contains one or two brief stories. Genial asides appear in the margins and further elucidate each magical creature. The author draws on a rich tradition of legends and myths, retelling them in an accessible manner that will captivate readers. Handsome scratchboard illustrations decorate the pages with stylized figures and landscapes. The vivid hues and interesting textures make an eye-catching combination. Descriptive borders herald each section and highlight motifs related to its subject (e.g., the paragraphs on dwarves are framed by anvils, pick axes, shovels, etc.). A source note puts the tales in perspective.<i>&#x2013;Harriett Fargnoli, Great Neck Library, NY</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The original edition of Amos Vogel&#39;s seminal book, Film as a Subversive Art was first published in 1974, and has been out of print since 1987. According to Vogel--founder of Cinema 16, North America&#39;s legendary film society--the book details the &#34;accelerating worldwide trend toward a more liberated cinema, in which subjects and forms hitherto considered unthinkable or forbidden are boldly explored.&#34; So ahead of his time was Vogel that the ideas that he penned some 30 years ago are still relevant today, and readily accessible in this classic volume. Accompanied by over 300 rare film stills, Film as a Subversive Art analyzes how aesthetic, sexual, and ideological subversives use one of the most powerful art forms of our day to exchange or manipulate our conscious and unconscious, demystify visual taboos, destroy dated cinematic forms, and undermine existing value systems and institutions. This subversion of form, as well as of content, is placed within the context of the contemporary world view of science, philosophy, and modern art, and is illuminated by a detailed examination of over 500 films, including many banned, rarely seen, or never released works.</p><p></p><h2>Winnie-the-Pooh on Management: In which a Very Important Bear and his friends are introduced to a Very...</h2><p>Combining the well-known characters and stories of A.

Agnon's famous masterpiece, his novel <i>Only Yesterday</i>, here appears in English translation for the first time. Published in 1945, the book tells a seemingly simple tale about a man who immigrates to Palestine with the Second Aliya--the several hundred idealists who returned between 1904 and 1914 to work the Hebrew soil as in Biblical times and revive Hebrew culture. <i>Only Yesterday</i> quickly became recognized as a monumental work of world literature, but not only for its vivid historical reconstruction of Israel's founding society. This epic novel also engages the reader in a fascinating network of meanings, contradictions, and paradoxes all leading to the question, what, if anything, controls human existence?</p><p>Seduced by Zionist slogans, young Isaac Kumer imagines the Land of Israel filled with the financial, social, and erotic opportunities that were denied him, the son of an impoverished shopkeeper, in Poland. Once there, he cannot find the agricultural work he anticipated. Instead Isaac happens upon house-painting jobs as he moves from secular, Zionist Jaffa, where the ideological fervor and sexual freedom are alien to him, to ultra-orthodox, anti-Zionist Jerusalem. While some of his Zionist friends turn capitalist, becoming successful merchants, his own life remains adrift and impoverished in a land torn between idealism and practicality, a place that is at once homeland and diaspora. Eventually he marries a religious woman in Jerusalem, after his worldly girlfriend in Jaffa rejects him.</p><p>Led astray by circumstances, Isaac always ends up in the place opposite of where he wants to be, but why? The text soars to Surrealist-Kafkaesque dimensions when, in a playful mode, Isaac drips paint on a stray dog, writing "Crazy Dog" on his back. Causing panic wherever he roams, the dog takes over the story, until, after enduring persecution for so long without "understanding" why, he really does go mad and bites Isaac. The dog has been interpreted as everything from the embodiment of Exile to a daemonic force, and becomes an unforgettable character in a book about the death of God, the deception of discourse, the power of suppressed eroticism, and the destiny of a people depicted in all its darkness and promise.</p></p><p><p>"[<i>Only Yesterday</i>] is considered [Agnon's] masterpiece and has a claim to being the Great Israeli Novel."<b>--Adam Kirsch,<i>New Yorker</i></b></p><p>"Ancient religious longing, modern political aspirations, and personal dreams of liberation all intersect....

He appears as a shepherd, a teacher, a healer, an enthroned god; he is an infant, a youth, and a bearded elder. But he is never dead. When he appears with the cross, he stands in front of it, serene, resurrected. The world around him is ablaze with beauty. These are images of paradise-paradise in this world, permeated and blessed by the presence of God.<br><br>But once Jesus perished, dying was virtually all he seemed able to do.<br><br><i>Saving Paradise</i> offers a fascinating new lens on the history of Christianity, from its first centuries to the present day, and asks how its early vision of beauty evolved into one of torture. In tracing the changes in society and theology that marked the medieval emergence of images of Christ crucified, <i>Saving Paradise</i> exposes the imperial strategies embedded in theologies of redemptive violence and sheds new light on Christianity's turn to holy war. It reveals how the New World, established through Christian conquest and colonization, is haunted by the loss of a spiritual understanding of paradise here and now.<br><br>Brock and Parker reconstruct the idea that salvation is paradise in this world and in this life, and they offer a bold new theology for saving paradise. They ground justice and peace for humanity in love for the earth and open a new future for Christianity through a theology of redemptive beauty.</p><p>Rebecca Ann Parker is president and professor of theology at Starr King School for the Ministry.Only rarely is a single book an event. This book is such a rarity. Rita Brock and Rebecca Parker show that solid scholarship can be expressed with passion and literary grace as they recover the beauty of an earth-loving Christianity lost for a thousand years beneath dry creeds and formulae and poisonous myths of sacralized violence.&#x2014;Daniel C.

Cone, author of <i>Malcolm &amp; Martin &amp; America</i><br><br>"<i>Saving Paradise</i> challenges us to recover an ancient world view that is life transforming and earth affirming. It reminds us of a biblical perspective that does not reserve paradise for the dead but invites the living to find grace, justice, peace and compassion-here and now-amid the jangling discord of violence and war. It may mark the beginning of a paradigm shift in contemporary Christian understanding and interfaith dialogue."&#x2014;Reverend James A. Forbes, Jr., president and founder of the Healing of the Nations Foundation, senior minister emeritus of the Riverside Church of New York City <br><br>"How did Christianity become a religion of finitude and guilt rather than one of promise and celebration?

This tangible past transformed their research and led them to see that paradise in this world lies at the heart of Christianity." &#x2014;Diane Apostolos-Cappadona, author of <i>Dictionary of Christian Art</i><br><br>"This powerful, unprecedented, and compelling book brings real Christianity out of the shadows.

These include the narrator, Meredith, who describes her life from childhood with a rebellious mother through early adulthood as a student at Columbia University; and her cousins, the spoiled and thoroughly unlikable Pearce and Felicity, who plays the unenviable role of custodian to their emotionally unstable mother. Other members of this seemingly incompetent-at-life family come and go in a narrative that shuttles between the present and the past via flashbacks and reminiscences of earlier generations; the settings include posh tribal dwellings in South Carolina and on an island off the coast of Maine, as well as locations in Connecticut, New York and Washington State. The constant leaps from one place to another, from past to present, from one dysfunctional rich relative to some equally maladapted kin, are off-putting and confusing. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.The action in Rust's deftly written first novel centers around Meredith, a wealthy young woman who is trying to overcome a childhood spent in a dysfunctional family plagued by drug addiction, alcoholism, and insanity. Haunted by the untimely death of her mother, who deserted Meredith and her father, she shuttles between a South Carolina plantation and a Maine vacation home owned by her mother's family. She must in turn deal with her cousin Felicity and Felicity's brother Pearce, who have their own demons to conquer, including their uncle's mysterious suicide. As she contrasts Meredith's developing strength of character with the defeatism that threatens to destroy her family, the author's disjointed style of reminiscence and unresolved conversations serves the theme of adolescent trauma quite well.

Benn&#x2019;s hit WWII-era mystery series, Lieutenant Billy Boyle goes undercover in the Vatican</b>.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lieutenant Billy Boyle could have used a rest after his last case, but when his girlfriend, Diana Seaton, a British spy, goes missing in the Vatican, where she was working undercover, he insists on being assigned to a murder investigation there so he can try to help her.<br> &nbsp;<br> An American monsignor is found murdered at the foot of Death's Door, one of the five entrances to Saint Peter's Basilica. Wild Bill Donovan, head of the OSS, wants the killing investigated. The fact that the Vatican is neutral territory in German-occupied Rome is only one of the obstacles Billy must overcome. First is a harrowing journey, smuggled into Rome while avoiding the Gestapo and Allied bombs. Then he must navigate Vatican politics and personalities&#x2014;some are pro-Allied, others pro-Nazi, and the rest steadfastly neutral&#x2014;to learn the truth about the murdered monsignor. But that's not his only concern; just a short walk from the Vatican border is the infamous Regina Coeli prison, where Diana is being held. Can he dare a rescue, or will a failed attempt alert the Germans to his mission and risk an open violation of Vatican neutrality?</p><p>James R. Benn is the author of six previous books in the Billy Boyle series: <i>Billy Boyle, The First Wave, Blood Alone, Evil for Evil , Rag &amp; Bone, </i>and<i> A Mortal Terror</i>. He was a librarian for many years. He lives in Hadlyme, Connecticut.CHAPTER ONE<br> <i>Brindisi, Italy</i><br> <i>February, 1944</i><br> &nbsp;<br> They must be in love, I thought, watching the couple as they danced to a scratchy tune on the Victrola. It was late, and the place was empty but for us, the dancers, and a waiter at the front entrance, trolling for customers. He&#x2019;d gotten bored refilling my wineglass, so I poured the last of the vino myself and listened to the song. Again, since it was the only record in the joint. <br> &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s that singing, Kaz?&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Carlo Buti. Very popular in Italy. Billy, are you listening to me?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Sure. Guy named Carlo Buti. What&#x2019;s the song about?&#x201d; I could count on Kaz to know stuff like this. He was smart in seven languages, but he didn&#x2019;t know everything, like when to mind his own business. He&#x2019;d been yammering at me for the past hour, and I&#x2019;d been doing my best not to pay him any mind.<br> &#x201c;He is singing to his lover,&#x201d; Kaz said, leaning back and listening. &#x201c;Love is beautiful when he is near her. It makes him dream, it makes him tremble. The usual romanticisms.&#x201d; <br> Kaz had his reasons to play the cynic, so I let it pass. He was probably right about the song anyway. The couple on the tiny dance floor swayed to the music, ignoring us and the waiter at the door, who called to a group of British officers to come in and try the mussels with fava beans. The dancers ignored the war, too, in a way Kaz and I could not. They were together, their arms interwoven, their passion thick in the night air. They were young, maybe nineteen or twenty, tops. She rested her cheek on his shoulder as his hand caressed the small of her back.<br> &#x201c;They must be in love,&#x201d; I said, out loud this time.<br> &#x201c;Indeed,&#x201d; Kaz said, finishing the wine in his glass. &#x201c;And moneyed, as well. She is wearing silk stockings, and he has a decent wristwatch. No visible scars or injuries on the young man either, so it is likely he is either very lucky&#x2014;which comes with money&#x2014;or he avoided military service with the Fascists. They are drinking a Brindisi Rosso Riserva, so he can afford more than a common table wine. He has been sneaking glances at his watch, so he must need to get her home soon. This is the only time he can be alone with her, and hold her, which is why they are dancing.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Not bad,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;How do you know she&#x2019;s not a prostitute?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Her shoes. They are expensive, and new. Also, they are still here, long after the meal is done. The young man would not wish to dance all night if he could take the young lady to bed. Therefore, he cannot. It is only a guess, but her parents must trust him to let her go out unattended. But, it is wartime, and these things may not be so important anymore.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You might have a career as a detective, Kaz.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve taught me to study a room and the people in it as soon as I enter. We have been at this table for so long, I&#x2019;ve had ample time. What are we doing here, Billy?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Having dinner, enjoying the view.&#x201d; I gestured to the harbor, across the road from the <i>ristorante</i>. A Royal Navy destroyer was tied up at the dock, and the muted sounds of sailors moving about drifted across the wide street that separated the wharf from the city. A line of palm trees rustled in the breeze. February in Brindisi was not much like February in Boston.<br> &#x201c;We finished eating hours ago. The wine was tolerable, more so than your company, I must say. Billy, face it. She is lost. By now, there is no hope. Why won&#x2019;t you listen to me?&#x201d;<br> Love is beautiful when you are near the one you love. When you can&#x2019;t be, it is terrible. It makes you dream, but the dreams aren&#x2019;t happy ones. And I tremble, too, along with Carlo Buti.<br> &#x201c;I do listen, Kaz. Is it true that the old Roman road ends here, in Brindisi?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;The Appian Way? Yes. Just around the corner, as a matter of fact. A Roman column marks the end as it comes down to the water. Why?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So we could leave here, start walking, and end up in Rome?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Well, yes. But it is almost three hundred miles, and the German Army might have something to say about it.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Yeah, that&#x2019;s a problem.&#x201d; I watched as a jeep full of American MPs drove slowly by, checking out the clientele. I rested my chin in the palm of my hand, tilting my head against my fingers to hide my face. The music had ended, and the young couple were gathering their things to leave. Almost midnight. The jeep stopped, and the MPs watched the lovebirds depart. There was a blackout in place, but the MPs were easy to spot with their white helmets shining in the moonlight. Light spilled out into the street, but the MPs didn&#x2019;t say anything, simply rolled on, probably admiring the young lady.<br> &#x201c;Are you in trouble with the MPs, Billy?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Not that I know of,&#x201d; I said, my hand going to the table. It was true enough.<br> &#x201c;Good, because this late, they may stop to question anyone out near the harbor.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Yeah, especially pretty girls. I think we&#x2019;re safe.&#x201d; Safe. I trembled.<br> &#x201c;Billy,&#x201d; Kaz said, laying his hand on my arm. I shook it off. &#x201c;We heard a week ago. The message took two days to get here. You know what that means.&#x201d;<br> <i> &#x201c;Due grappe,&#x201d;</i> I said, signaling the waiter. Maybe another drink would shut Kaz up, but I doubted it.<br> &#x201c;It means that by the time we learned she was taken, the Gestapo had let her sit alone in a cell for two days, listening to the screams of the tortured,&#x201d; Kaz said. &#x201c;To soften her up. Standard Nazi practice.&#x201d;<br> <i> &#x201c;Grazie,&#x201d;</i> I said as the waiter set down the drinks. I raised my glass, but Kaz ignored me.<br> &#x201c;The first day might not have been too bad,&#x201d; he continued. &#x201c;They apologize for keeping you waiting, offering tea, coffee, cigarettes. A rational discussion, to size the prisoner up. Some might give up information then, in the hopes of staying alive and keeping their fingernails.&#x201d;<br> I drank half the glass down, the fiery liquor harsh in my throat. I didn&#x2019;t look at Kaz.<br> &#x201c;But it is all a ruse,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;To raise the prisoner&#x2019;s hopes and then dash them. Later that day, the actual torture begins. That would have been six and a half days ago. And the Gestapo would have worked fast, knowing that once an agent is captured, the rest of their group will go into hiding as soon as they hear of it.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;When did you become an expert in Gestapo torture?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I was briefed by an SOE colonel.&#x201d; The Special Operations Executive, Great Britain&#x2019;s spy and sabotage outfit. Set up in a villa outside of Brindisi, they sent the young and the willing to do the dirty work of winning a war for the old who had too much to lose. They had their own Royal Air Force squadron at their beck and call, plus a small army of forgers, tailors, demolitions experts, commandos, and smugglers. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t want to know the rest. Suffice it to say, six days is more than any mortal can stand.&#x201d;<br> I finished the grappa. <br> &#x201c;They call their torture chambers kitchens,&#x201d; Kaz said. &#x201c;That should give you some idea of what they do. If prisoners don&#x2019;t talk, they will likely die from the interrogation. If they do talk, they are often shot once the information is verified. Or sent to a concentration camp. Either way, she is dead by now, or beyond all redemption.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;How does SOE know all this?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;It is their job to know these things.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> &#x201c;But how can they, if all prisoners are killed or sent to concentration camps? There would be no way to learn those details.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;There have been some escapes. And a very few people have been let go. Even the Gestapo makes mistakes.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Interesting,&#x201d; I said.<br> &#x201c;No, it is terrible. And what is worse is that you should cling to any hope.&#x201d; Now it was Kaz&#x2019;s turn to drink. He took one gulp, and then finished the rest. His lips curled against his teeth as he swallowed, and the scar on the side of his face seemed to redden. Our eyes met, and I wondered which of us was the worse off. Kaz had been head over heels in love when I first met him. And Daphne Seaton had loved him too, but that all ended in an explosion that killed her and maimed him in body and soul. Daphne was never coming back, and that certainty haunted Kaz.<br> I<i> </i>was haunted by uncertainty. Was Diana, Daphne&#x2019;s sister, alive? Diana Seaton worked for the SOE, and had been reported taken by the Gestapo in Rome, where she was operating undercover as a nun. Was she dead? I couldn&#x2019;t believe it. But I couldn&#x2019;t do anything about it either, and it was tearing me up inside. Not that I would ever say it to Kaz, but I was jealous of him. He knew, straight out. I wondered, wept, and trembled again.<br> &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go,&#x201d; I said. I threw cash down on the table, probably enough for a dozen dinners. &#x201c;Show me the Appian Way.&#x201d;<br> Kaz led the way, passing a bombed-out building, around a corner and up too damn many stone steps. At the top, a single Roman column stood, next to a pedestal where its twin had once been. <br> &#x201c;It is more correct to say this is where the Via Appia ends,&#x201d; Kaz said. &#x201c;There is no beginning here.&#x201d;<br> The wind whipped around us as I gazed out over the harbor, the moon reflected in the low, lapping waves. Warships of all sizes floated in the calm waters, their immense guns immobile. Why weren&#x2019;t they helping us get to Rome? Why did they sit, useless, in the Mediterranean night?<br> &#x201c;How much longer are you here?&#x201d; I asked. <br> Kaz&#x2014;Lieutenant (and Baron) Piotr Augustus Kazimierz, of the Polish Army in Exile&#x2014;had been detailed to liaison duties with the Polish II Corps, currently making its way to the Italian front from Egypt by way of Taranto, on the heel of Italy. Kaz and I both worked for General Eisenhower, and we often found ourselves loaned out when the General had no pressing matters at hand, investigating murders and other crimes that might impede the war effort.<br> &#x201c;I have orders to return to London at the end of the week. Getting the Polish Corps supplied and coordinated with Eighth Army is nearly complete,&#x201d; Kaz said. &#x201c;I am sorry I haven&#x2019;t been around to help you. Too much paperwork and meetings. All terribly boring.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Nothing you could have done,&#x201d; I said. I&#x2019;d spent every day, every hour, trying to get information about Diana&#x2014;from the SOE, MI6, even Allied Command at Caserta&#x2014;but had come up empty all around.<br> &#x201c;What about you, Billy? Have you heard from Colonel Harding?&#x201d; Harding was our immediate boss in General Eisenhower&#x2019;s headquarters.<br> &#x201c;Yes, I have,&#x201d; I said, pulling a thick wad of documents from my jacket pocket. &#x201c;Orders to return to London two days after we found out about Diana. Orders to proceed to the airfield at Brindisi for priority transportation to London. Inquiries demanding to know my location. And today, orders for me to return immediately or face court-martial for desertion.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Billy, you have to leave. You can&#x2019;t ignore orders from Supreme Headquarters.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Oh yeah?&#x201d; I held the papers up over my head and let them go. The wind lifted them and carried them out over the harbor, where they fell like tears into the sea.</p><h2>That Old Cape Magic</h2><p>Signed by Richard Russo on a page tipped in by the publisher.

Bookstore "Autographed Copy" sticker on the front panel.</p><p><strong>Book Description</strong><br> Following <em>Bridge of Sighs</em>&#x2014;a national best seller hailed by <em>The Boston Globe</em> as &#x201c;an astounding achievement&#x201d; and &#x201c;a masterpiece&#x201d;&#x2014;Richard Russo gives us the story of a marriage, and of all the other ties that bind, from parents and in-laws to children and the promises of youth.<br> <p>Griffin has been tooling around for nearly a year with his father&#x2019;s ashes in the trunk, but his mother is very much alive and not shy about calling on his cell phone. She does so as he drives down to Cape Cod, where he and his wife, Joy, will celebrate the marriage of their daughter Laura&#x2019;s best friend. For Griffin this is akin to driving into the past, since he took his childhood summer vacations here, his parents&#x2019; respite from the hated Midwest. And the Cape is where he and Joy honeymooned, in the course of which they drafted the Great Truro Accord, a plan for their lives together that&#x2019;s now thirty years old and has largely come true. He&#x2019;d left screenwriting and Los Angeles behind for the sort of New England college his snobby academic parents had always aspired to in vain; they&#x2019;d moved into an old house full of character; and they&#x2019;d started a family. Check, check and check.</p> <p>But be careful what you pray for, especially if you manage to achieve it. By the end of this perfectly lovely weekend, the past has so thoroughly swamped the present that the future suddenly hangs in the balance. And when, a year later, a far more important wedding takes place, their beloved Laura&#x2019;s, on the coast of Maine, Griffin&#x2019;s chauffeuring two urns of ashes as he contends once more with Joy and her large, unruly family, and both he and she have brought dates along. How in the world could this have happened?</p> <p><em>That Old Cape Magic</em> is a novel of deep introspection and every family feeling imaginable, with a middle-aged man confronting his parents and their failed marriage, his own troubled one, his daughter&#x2019;s new life and, finally, what it was he thought he wanted and what in fact he has. The storytelling is flawless throughout, moments of great comedy and even hilarity alternating with others of rueful understanding and heart-stopping sadness, and its ending is at once surprising, uplifting and unlike anything this Pulitzer Prize winner has ever written.</p> <p></p> <strong>A Q&amp;A with Richard Russo</strong><br> <p><strong>Question:</strong> Apparently there is a wedding phenomenon you have termed "Table 17." What exactly is that and how does it relate to this novel?</p> <p><strong>Richard Russo:</strong> A few years ago my wife and I were invited to a wedding and were seated at what was clearly a "leftover" table. It reminded me of the final teams who get into the NCAA tournament. You can tell by their seeding that they were the last ones in, that they almost didn't make the grade. Table 17 works thematically in the novel because being among strangers, not sure whether you belong, may be the main character's future if he can't find a way to slow his downward spiral.</p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> You have said that <em>That Old Cape Magic</em> began as a short story. What was the moment you knew it was calling out to be a novel?</p> <p><strong>Richard Russo:</strong> Griffin, my main character, begins the story on his way to a wedding with his father's urn in the trunk of his car. I planned for him to scatter the ashes (his past), put his future in danger at the wedding (his present) and then pull back from disaster at the last moment. But then he pulled over to the side of the road in his convertible to take a phone call from his mother, at the end of which a seagull sh**s on him. At that moment, in part because Griffin blames her, he and I both had a sinking feeling. You can resolve thematic issues of past, present and future in a twenty page story, but if you allow a sh**ting seagull into it, you&#x2019;ve suddenly moved on to something much larger.</p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> Why did you choose the Cape?</p> <p><strong>Richard Russo:</strong> For some time I've been fascinated with the idea of "a finer place" (see Lucy Lynch and Bobby Marconi in <em>Bridge of Sighs</em>). I'm talking about both fiction and real life. Why do people believe that happiness is more likely to find you in one place than another? It has something with what you can and can't afford, what you think you'll one day be able to swing if things go well. Except that even when they go well, you discover it's still unaffordable, which gives the desired place a magical quality. The faster you run toward it, the faster it runs away from you. I chose the Cape because it's always been expensive and just keeps getting more so, but it could have been any number of similar places. For Griffin's parents, two academics, a house on the Cape would have always been just beyond their reach. One of their many dubious genetic gifts to Griffin is a sense that happiness is always on the horizon, never where you're standing. Very American, I think.</p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> <em>That Old Cape Magic</em> is book ended by two weddings and becomes the story of Griffin's own marriage as well as that of his parents and the impending one of his daughter. Is there some loaded charge to weddings that unleashes the past and threatens the future in a way unlike other events? Or, in other words, what were you up to in framing your story with two weddings?</p> <p><strong>Richard Russo:</strong> It probably won't surprise readers to discover that both my daughters were married during the time I was writing this book, which, if it does well, will pay for their weddings. One of our girls was married in London, which except for the expense made things easier on my wife and me. Living in the states, how much could we really be blamed for things that went wrong so far from home? Our other daughter was married in the coastal Maine town where we live, and her wedding was therefore larger. My wife and I feared that our families, who were largely unknown to each other and living on opposite sides of the country (not to mention the political spectrum), might be fissionable. Mostly we feared for the family of the groom, and maybe even the town, since we hoped to continue living there. In the second wedding of That Old Cape Magic I imagined an absolutely catastrophic wedding in hopes it might act as a talisman against real-life disaster, which it appears to have done.</p> <p>Planning your children's weddings also gets you thinking back to your own and making the inevitable comparisons. My wife and I were grad-student poor when we got married in Tucson, and our parents were only marginally better off. Our honeymoon was four days in Mexico. We'd booked the sleeper car but managed to arrive late, actually jumping onto the moving train. They'd given our sleeper to someone else and we had to sit in the aisles on our luggage for several hours until seats became available. Neither of us got a wink of sleep and, naturally, when we arrived in Mazatlan early the next morning, our room wasn't ready. We changed into bathing suits, went to the beach and immediately fell asleep under the brutal tropical sun. By the time we woke up we were burned so badly we couldn't touch each other for the rest of the trip. But we were young and the tacos were good and so was the tequila and we'd brought plenty of books and we talked about our future and who we'd be in that future, and pretty damn quick it was thirty-five years later. That's just about how long the Griffins have been married when <em>That Old Cape Magic</em> opens.</p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> Griffin's parents, both academics trapped in what they call the "mid f***ing west," are such wonderful, sometimes maddening, often hilarious, always surprising characters. You've mined the satiric potential of academia before, most notably in <em>Straight Man</em>. Have you been longing to go back there?</p> <p><strong>Richard Russo:</strong> I thought I'd got all the academic satire out of my system with <em>Straight Man</em>, but apparently not. Actually, since writing that novel I've entered another world&#x2014;movie making&#x2014;that would be equally idiotic except that instead of academic scrip it involves real money. In this novel, because Griffin's a former screenwriter, I got to compare lunacies. It wasn't a fair fight, of course. Academics are really the only ones in their weight class (heavy).</p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> At the start of the novel Griffin is a man in his mid fifties who seemingly has everything going for him, a great marriage, a great daughter, the career he aspired to, basically everything he had on his wish list when first venturing out in adulthood. Then, within a year, he watches it all come unglued. It&#x2019;s amazing how quickly that can happen, no?</p> <p><strong>Richard Russo:</strong> That's the other similarity between this book and <em>Straight Man</em>. In both novels we watch men who are tenured in life. Safe, in other words. But there's just this one little thread on the sweater. You know you should clip it, not pull it, but there are no scissors at hand and what's the worst that can happen? The answer to that question, in this instance, is <em>That Old Cape Magic</em>.</p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> Have you actually ever been to a wedding where a guest was trapped in a tree?</p> <p><strong>Richard Russo:</strong> I myself have never been to a wedding where a guest got stuck in a tree, but we're attending a wedding on the Cape this summer and I have high hopes.</p> (Photo � Elena Seibert)<b>Richard Russo</b> lives with his wife in Camden, Maine, and in Boston.

For additional information, please visit www.newwayministries.org.</p>Psychologist and author Crabb (<i>Connecting</i>) serves up what could be his magnum opus, combining his passions for Bible teaching, counseling, and people healing one another in communities. Written as an ongoing dialogue between the author and God about the 66 books of the Bible, Crabb uses first person for both voices, taking to the nth degree the common idea that the Bible is a love letter from God. The author's persona progressively learns deeper truths about God's love from each letter, or book, of the Bible. Through the voice of God, Crabb takes on today's culture and Christian subculture. Section introductions and 66 summary paragraphs at the end tie all together well. The book addresses much for what skeptics ask but will serve Christians who have ignored or conveniently overlooked the arc of the Bible story and chosen a chirpy version of Christianity that Crabb calls good enough Christianity. His psychological and biblical perspective and decades of experience give the otherwise presumptuous attempt at voicing God credibility. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This time she hits the trifecta: the personal stories of Sam and Maggie, the history and lore of Chinese cuisine, and an inside look at cultural dislocation. Maggie McElroy is a widowed American food writer who is suddenly confronted with a paternity claim against her late husband's estate--by a Chinese family. Her editor offers her another reason to go to Beijing: write an article about a rising young Chinese-American-Jewish chef, Sam Liang. Having sold the home she had with her late husband Matt and reduced her possessions to only the barest necessities, with her life feeling as though it is contracting around her, Maggie embraces the oppportunity to sort out her feelings about Matt's supposed infidelity and do some work at the same time. <p> She and Sam hit it off right away, even though he is involved in a very important competition for a place on the Chinese national cooking team for the 2008 Olympics. They travel together to the south of China where she meets her husband's possible daughter--with Sam standing by to act as translator--and where Maggie meets much of Sam's family. He has been welcomed back with open arms, even though he occasionally feels that he has one foot in China and one in Ohio. The Beijing uncles and the Hangzhou uncle are a raucous, loving, argumentative bunch of foodies who advise Sam about menus, encourage a romance with Maggie, make him start over again when the dish isn't perfect, and alternately praise and criticize his cooking. </p><p> Maggie loves being in the middle of it all and finds herself more and more drawn to Sam. She begins, with Sam's help, to see food as "healing" and understands the guanxi or "connectedness" that takes place around food. At the beginning of each chapter is a paragraph taken from a book entitled <i>The Last Chinese Chef</i>, written by Sam's grandfather and translated by Sam and his father. Mones has written that book, too, which is an explanation of the place of food in Chinese history and family life. The novel is rich with meaning and lore and an examination of loving relationships. Don't even touch this book when you're hungry. The descriptions make the aromas and textures float right off the page. --<i>Valerie Ryan</i></p>Nicole Mones is a contributor for Houghton Mifflin titles including &#39;The Last Chinese Chef.&#39;</p><h2>Blood Rites: Origins and History of the Passions of War</h2><p>An ALA Notable Book<br>A New York Times Notable Book<br><br>In <i>Blood Rites</i>, Barbara Ehrenreich confronts the mystery of the human attraction to violence: What draws our species to war and even makes us see it as a kind of sacred undertaking? Blood Rites takes us on an original journey from the elaborate human sacrifices of the ancient world to the carnage and holocaust of twentieth-century "total war." Sifting through the fragile records of prehistory, Ehrenreich discovers the wellspring of war in an unexpected place--not in a "killer instinct" unique to the males of our species but in the blood rites early humans performed to reenact their terrifying experience of predation by stronger carnivores. Brilliant in conception, rich in scope, Blood Rites is a monumental work that will transform our understanding of the greatest single threat to human life.<br></p><p>In this ambitious work, Barbara Ehrenreich offers a daring explanation for humans' propensity to wage war. Rather than approach the subject from a physiological perspective, pinpointing instinct or innate aggressiveness as the violent culprit, she reaches back to primitive man's fear of predators and the anxieties associated with life in the food chain. To deal with the reality of living as prey, she argues that blood rites were created to dramatize and validate the life-and-death struggle. Jumping ahead to the modern age, Ehrenreich brands nationalism a more sophisticated form of blood ritual, a phenomenon that conjures similar fears of predation, whether in the form of lost territory or the more extreme ethnic cleansing. <i>Blood Rites: Origins and History of the Passions of War</i> may not offer a cure for human aggression, but the author does present a convincing argument for the difficulties associated with achieving peace.Barbara Ehrenreich is the author of nine widely acclaimed books, including <i>Fear of Falling</i> and <i>The Hearts of Men</i>. A regular essayist for <i>Time</i>, she has written for every major magazine and newspaper in the country. She lives near Key West, Florida.<br></p><h2>Closer to the Light: Learning from Near Death Experiences of Children</h2><p>Case studies of near-death experiences in children reveal the patients&#39; ability to communicate with deceased relatives and friends, as well as their experiences while dead</p><p>Thirty-two years ago, my mother's best friend died on the operating table. She felt herself moving toward a brilliant light and spoke with her father who had passed away years before. Ultimately, she made the decision to return to take care of her two young children. Although this was the most peaceful experience of her life, she kept it a secret until the publication of books like CLOSER TO THE LIGHT and TRANSFORMED BY THE LIGHT. Reading the experiences of others gave her the freedom to speak openly about what it means to die and why there is little to fear.<br>Lorelei Andrysick<br>Ballantine Advertisinghave had their say; now listen to the experts.

However, when organized crime reared its ugly head in the late 1920s in Brooklyn, at the foundation were men like Meyer Lansky and Ben Siegel--both Jews. Rich Cohen's romantic account of Jewish gangsters, <i>Tough Jews</i>, brings to life the story of Jewish involvement in the world of organized crime. <p> Cohen persuasively achieves his objective by recounting the stories he heard from his father, who grew up with his friends (including broadcaster Larry King) at the end of the gangster era in Brooklyn, finding heroes in men like "Kid Twist" Reles and Bugsy Goldstein. The intriguing tales Cohen heard, although slightly embellished over time, offer a rare glimpse into a world that can barely be related to today's generation of Jews living in America. These Jews went to prison for committing violent felonies, not white-collar crimes, and got the chair for it. Inspired by their stories, Cohen went on to conduct extensive research through old journals, police records, and court reports to uncover the real stories behind the tales he heard as a boy.</p><p> Cohen warmly discusses his father's fascination with these powerful, charismatic figures, and openly envies his experiences at a time before Jewish people lived under the debilitating shadow of the Holocaust. In addition, Cohen shows compassion for the need of his father's generation to look up to "someone who gives them the illusion of strength." <i>--Jeremy Storey</i></p>In an L.A. delicatessen, a group of Brooklyn natives gets together to discuss basketball, boxing, the weather back east, and the Jewish gangsters of yesteryear. Meyer Lansky. Bugsy Siegel. Louis Lepke, the self-effacing mastermind of Murder, Inc. Red Levine, the Orthodox hit man who refused to kill on the Sabbath. Abe "Kid Twist" Reles, who looked like a mama's boy but once buried a rival alive. These are just some of the vibrant, vicious characters Rich Cohen's father reminisced about and the author evokes so pungently in Tough Jews. <br>Tracing a generation of Jewish gangsters from the candy stores of Brownsville to the clubhouses of the Lower East Side--and, occasionally, to suites at the Waldorf--Cohen creates a densely anecdotal and gruesomely funny history of muscle, moxie, and money. Filled with fixers and schlammers, the squeal of tires and the rattle of gunfire, his book shatters stereotypes as deftly as its subjects once shattered kneecaps.</p><h2>Vegan Planet, Revised Edition: 425 Irresistible Recipes With Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World</h2><p>When it first appeared in 2003, Vegan Planet revolutionized animal-free cooking. Robin Robertson&#39;s pioneering book played a leading role in the passage of veganism from subculture to mainstream culinary lifestyle. Its breadth and variety of fantastically flavorful food not only gave vegans what they craved, it gave them food they could serve up happily to their non-vegan family members and friends. One decade and more than 100,000 copies later, this important classic is back in a thoroughly revised edition. Vegan cookbooks are big sellers today, but in a thicket of topical and niche titles there&#39;s a need for an everyday cooking bible on which vegan cooks can rely. The new Vegan Planet meets that need handsomely. Robertson&#39;s extensive updates cover such things as: the newly expanded range of whole grains that are available; super greens, such as kale and chard, that are rising in popularity; new facts concerning which cooking oils are healthiest and most earth-friendly; and new saucing and flavoring ideas from the global pantry. Throughout, there&#39;s the spirit of adventure and of culinary creativity that has cemented Robertson&#39;s reputation at the top of the vegan pantheon.</p><p><p><b>Robin Robertson </b>is a veteran restaurant chef, cooking teacher, and an acclaimed writer.

A critical biography, <i>Seven Dirty Words</i> is an insightful (and, of course, hilarious) examination of Carlin's body of work as it pertained to its cultural times and the man who created it, from his early days as amore-or-less conventional comedian to his stunning transformation into the subversive comedic voice of the emerging counterculture. Sullivan also chronicles Carlin's struggles with censorship and drugs, as well as the full-blown renaissance he experienced in the 1990s, both personally and professionally, when he became an elder statesman to a younger generation of comics who revered him. <i>Seven Dirty Words</i> is nothing less than the definitive biography of an American master who changed the world, and also a work of cultural commentary which frames George Carlin's extraordinary legacy.</p><p><b>James Sullivan</b> is a regular contributor to the <i>Boston Globe</i>.

We are not economic beings. We are not political beings. We are not digital beings or analog beings, social beings or solitary beings. We are mortal beings. And in that is every important thing to know about how we must live.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, October 2014:</strong> True or false: Modern medicine is a miracle that has transformed all of our lives.</p> <p>If you said &#x201c;true,&#x201d; you&#x2019;d be right, of course, but that&#x2019;s a statement that demands an asterisk, a &#x201c;but.&#x201d; &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been wrong about what our job is in medicine,&#x201d; writes Atul Gawande, a surgeon (at Brigham and Women&#x2019;s Hospital in Boston) and a writer (at the New Yorker). &#x201c;We think. . .[it] is to ensure health and survival. But really. . .it is to enable well-being. And well-being is about the reasons one wishes to be alive.&#x201d; Through interviews with doctors, stories from and about health care providers (such as the woman who pioneered the notion of &#x201c;assisted living&#x201d; for the elderly)&#x2014;and eventually, by way of the story of his own father&#x2019;s dying, Gawande examines the cracks in the system of health care to the aged (i.e. 97 percent of medical students take no course in geriatrics) and to the seriously ill who might have different needs and expectations than the ones family members predict. (One striking example: the terminally ill former professor who told his daughter that &#x201c;quality of life&#x201d; for him meant the ongoing ability to enjoy chocolate ice cream and watch football on TV. If medical treatments might remove those pleasures, well, then, he wasn&#x2019;t sure he would submit to such treatments.) Doctors don&#x2019;t listen, Gawande suggests&#x2014;or, more accurately, they don&#x2019;t know what to listen for. (Gawande includes examples of his own failings in this area.) Besides, they&#x2019;ve been trained to want to find cures, attack problems&#x2014;to win. But victory doesn&#x2019;t look the same to everyone, he asserts. Yes, &#x201c;death is the enemy,&#x201d; he writes. &#x201c;But the enemy has superior forces. Eventually, it wins. And in a war that you cannot win, you don&#x2019;t want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation. You don&#x2019;t want Custer. You want Robert E. Lee... someone who knows how to fight for territory that can be won and how to surrender it when it can&#x2019;t.&#x201d; In his compassionate, learned way, Gawande shows all of us&#x2014;doctors included&#x2014;how mortality must be faced, with both heart and mind. &#x2013; <i>Sara Nelson</i></p>ATUL GAWANDE is a surgeon, writer, and public health researcher.

Hungry for a chance to get her manuscript onto the desk of an experienced editor, Alley jumps at the opportunity to help Reade finish his latest novel.<br> <br>After surviving an absurd three-day &#x201c;trial period&#x201d; involving a .44 magnum, purple-pyramid acid, violent verbal outbursts, brushes with fame and the law, a bevy of peacocks, and a whole lot of cocaine, Alley is invited to stay at the compound where Reade works. For months Alley attempts to coax the novel out of Walker page-by-page, all while battling his endless procrastination, vampiric schedule, Herculean substance abuse, mounting debt, and casual gunplay. But as the job begins to take a toll on her psyche, Alley realizes she&#x2019;s alone in the Colorado Rockies at the mercy of a drug-addicted literary icon who may never produce another novel&#x2014;and her fate may already be sealed.<br> <br>A smart, rollicking ride told with heart, <i>Gonzo Girl</i> is a loving fictional portrait of a larger-than-life literary icon.</p><p>Cheryl Della Pietra is a longtime New York City magazine editor, writer, and copy editor. She has published numerous stories in such magazines as <i>Marie Claire</i>,<i> Redbook</i>, and <i>POV Magazine</i>. After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania, she lived with Hunter S. Thompson in Woody Creek, Colorado, for several months in 1992, where she worked as his assistant. She currently lives in Branford, Connecticut, with her husband and son.Gonzo Girl <br> <br>CHAPTER 1<br> <br>Everybody is laughing except for me. I&#x2019;m scanning the faces, trying to remember names, as they listen to Walker Reade recite from his novel in progress. To my right sits Devaney Peltier&#x2014;that&#x2019;s how she introduced herself to me, first and last name, like she&#x2019;s kind of a big deal. She&#x2019;s Walker&#x2019;s full-time girlfriend, and she&#x2019;s braying like a donkey, the act made more absurd by the rings of white powder encircling her nostrils like two tiny powdered doughnuts. Claudia Reynolds, the aging assistant, is curled up across from me, gazing at Walker in adoration, laughing the hardest. To my left sits Rene Wang&#x2014;or enfant terrible artist Rene Wang, as he&#x2019;s been described, without fail, in the New York City media since the day in 1983 when he famously set dozens of roosters loose in Times Square in a performance-art piece he called Koch&#x2019;s Cocks Can. He&#x2019;s chuckling lightly, his lips pursed, eyebrows up&#x2014;his &#x201c;hysterical&#x201d; look, I will later learn&#x2014;as he taps a long ash from his Davidoff cigarette into the mermaid-shaped tray on the table before him. I don&#x2019;t have to work to recall the names of the other two people here. They&#x2019;re undeniably famous. Crushed up beside Rene, almost sitting in his lap, is former vice-presidential candidate George Stains, his head thrown back, lips glossed with scotch, a small drop of blood dried at the bottom of one nostril. And next to Claudia is Larry Lucas, former teenage heartthrob, now Oscar-winning actor, doubled over like a man passing a kidney stone. Everyone is in hysterics. The only problem is, I&#x2019;m not sure what they&#x2019;re laughing at.<br> <br>Devaney passes a large tray of cocaine to me&#x2014;if it were flour, it would be enough to bake a small cake&#x2014;and I smile and nod, as if she were handing me a plate full of mini-quiche. I have, to this point in my life, done exactly two lines of coke, with an ex&#x2013;college boyfriend. He was filthy rich, and coke is what the filthy-rich college boys did when it was time to do drugs. I did those lines to try to fit in with his crowd&#x2014;the same conundrum I&#x2019;m weighing right now. To stall, I daintily perch the tray on my knee and listen politely. A notebook sits on the table in front of me. I brought it here to Colorado from New York City. It&#x2019;s a reporter&#x2019;s notebook, the kind I sometimes use for my own writing. I think it will be good for taking notes. I think it will show I am serious about wanting this job.<br> <br>&#x201c;That is so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. fucking&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. funny, Walker,&#x201d; says Larry, as I try to keep my face from flushing. Larry Lucas, it&#x2019;s worth noting, played the leading man in several of the teen comedies of my adolescence and, suffice to say, played a leading role in more than a few of my teenage NC-17 fantasies. Under other, less overwhelming circumstances, I might be breathless about the fact that I can reach out and touch him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Y&#x2019;all&#x2019;re&#x2019;funny, Walker, baby,&#x201d; says Devaney, threatening to turn an entire sentence into a contraction.<br> <br>When, after several more seconds of collective howling, my gaze drifts back to Claudia, I notice something: her eyes are open wide, unblinking, pleading. I can be a little dense in moments like these&#x2014;too caught up in processing my surroundings&#x2014;but I sense that she might be signaling me to do something. She&#x2019;s smiling at me wide and crazy, like some kind of insane puppet. Then it occurs to me a second too late.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m supposed to be laughing, too.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, new girl.&#x201d; My head snaps toward Walker, and I reach for my notebook, still balancing the enormous tray I&#x2019;ve yet to partake from.<br> <br>Rene, sensing opportunity, reaches for the coke. &#x201c;Let me help you out with that, honey,&#x201d; he says, his face entirely too close to mine. He snorts two quick lines and passes the tray to George, barely looking at him. The room is eerily quiet as I scan the faces once more. We&#x2019;re in Walker&#x2019;s living-room-cum-kitchen, the six of us arranged on his perfectly circular couch like numbers on a leather clockface. A round coffee table is at the center of the couch, and it holds the group&#x2019;s detritus: George&#x2019;s scotch glass and bottle of Dewar&#x2019;s, Rene&#x2019;s pack of Davidoffs, Claudia&#x2019;s Dunhill blues, Devaney&#x2019;s Newports, Larry&#x2019;s Heineken, an enormous unsmoked joint, the aforementioned mermaid ashtray, a matching dolphin ashtray, my highball of Wild Turkey, Claudia&#x2019;s glass of red wine, Rene&#x2019;s Metaxa sidecar, which I helped him mix in an effort at chumminess, and Devaney&#x2019;s vodka and cranberry. The tray of coke never really settles on the table. It just keeps getting passed around like it&#x2019;s crowd-surfing at a Hole concert.<br> <br>The only way to get on and off the couch is by climbing over the back. The only person not on the couch is Walker, who is perched behind us on a barstool tucked into a long counter. There&#x2019;s little doubt about the message the seating arrangement sends: he&#x2019;s the captain on this ship of fools.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hello? Is she alive?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, Walker, sorry,&#x201d; I say.<br> <br>&#x201c;What are you sorry about?&#x201d;<br> <br>I look around the room for another cue. Claudia is now focused on rolling a piece of lint between her thumb and forefinger.<br> <br>&#x201c;Go easy on her, Walker. She&#x2019;s just getting the lay of the land,&#x201d; Larry says.<br> <br>Walker ignores Larry completely and fixes his aviator sunglasses on me. &#x201c;Speak, for Christ&#x2019;s sake!&#x201d;<br> <br>My heart begins pounding so hard I can feel it in my ears. The strangers here probably wouldn&#x2019;t offer me more than mildly detached concern under normal circumstances. But now that every�one is coked up and drunk, I am little more than a buzzkill. I knew this outburst was coming one way or another. I knew from the books, the articles, the interviews. I have done my homework. Walker Reade does not suffer fools, and no one&#x2014;not presidents, CEOs, law enforcement&#x2014;gets a pass. I also know from said research that caving is worse. I square my shoulders to him and try to remain calm. &#x201c;I was just listening, Walker. If I&#x2019;m going to be your assistant, I need to know the story.&#x201d;<br> <br>Walker stares at me now from over his sunglasses. His eyes are a pale steel blue. &#x201c;That doesn&#x2019;t mean you can&#x2019;t enjoy it, too.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But I was enjoying it. Very much.&#x201d; Walker worries his Zippo around in his hand. I can make out the skull and crossbones on the front of it every other turn. He grabs a Dunhill red from the pack in front of him; the room is so quiet that the schk of the lighter visibly startles Rene, who appears to run at two speeds: aggressively engaged or disconcertingly spaced-out.<br> <br>&#x201c;Then crack a smile, dumbhead.&#x201d;<br> <br>George clears his throat and passes the tray of coke to Claudia, who immediately passes it to Larry. Everyone is quiet, waiting to see what&#x2019;s going to happen next, including me.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not dumb,&#x201d; I stammer back, sounding far less convincing than I had hoped.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; Walker says. &#x201c;Alessandra here went to an Ivy League school.&#x201d; Devaney shifts uncomfortably on the couch. I can actually hear her teeth grinding. &#x201c;It says so right here, on her thin r�sum�.&#x201d;<br> <br>Walker pulls a piece of paper from a folder on the counter in front of him, and I visibly recoil. I&#x2019;m a year out of college. The last thing I want is a staged reading of my r�sum� in front of this crowd.<br> <br>&#x201c;I thought it was great,&#x201d; I say.<br> <br>&#x201c;Which part?&#x201d; He blows a cloud of smoke directly in front of him, seemingly unaware that it wafts directly onto Devaney&#x2019;s head.<br> <br>In truth I cannot recall a single coherent passage from what has just been read to me, and I briefly wonder what superman at Burch Press is tasked with making this book readable. &#x201c;All of it, Walker. It&#x2019;s really funny.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;All right. What does it remind you of? Which of my works does it remind you of?&#x201d; He takes off his Tilley hat and sunglasses and downs the rest of his Chivas and water. Without his signature armor&#x2014;aviators and hat&#x2014;he&#x2019;s suddenly transformed from iconic writer/drug-addled playboy to unexpectedly sexy middle-school math teacher. He&#x2019;s only in his early fifties; I didn&#x2019;t expect him to be almost completely bald.<br> <br>I can feel the clock ticking. What does it remind me of? I&#x2019;ve read all of Walker&#x2019;s books many times over, except the last two&#x2014;the penultimate one a collection of political essays regurgitated from various magazines, and the most recent one so poorly reviewed that I couldn&#x2019;t justify allocating even a fraction of my meager financial resources toward it. The previous five were so fluid and tight that nothing about what he&#x2019;s just read reminds me of any of them.<br> <br>I glance back at Claudia. She&#x2019;s trying&#x2014;and failing&#x2014;to subtly mouth something to me. I look to Larry, who simply scrunches up his face and runs his hand through his thick, dark hair, winking, a gesture that I assume is intended to convey that this drill is somehow par for the course. Larry passes the tray of coke to Walker, trying to distract him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Here you go, big guy. Let&#x2019;s have some fun. When does the game start?&#x201d; The crowd is ostensibly here for an NBA play-off game.<br> <br>&#x201c;Half an hour,&#x201d; Walker says shortly, passing the tray to Devaney while still staring at me. Rene lights up the joint, choking mightily on the first drag.<br> <br>&#x201c;Am I in a time warp here? Is time standing still for anyone else? I asked a goddamn question. What does it remind you of?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The second half of The Wake?&#x201d; I say halfheartedly, referring to Walker&#x2019;s fourth novel.<br> <br>Walker actually ponders this for a moment&#x2014;surprised, I think, that I&#x2019;ve answered him. After a long pause, he says, in overly dramatic fashion, &#x201c;Why, oh why, can&#x2019;t I find someone with half a brain in her head to fucking help me? It&#x2019;s not like I&#x2019;m trying to find a neurosurgeon with a pretty face.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You would think I was looking for someone to take notes in Mandarin&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or separate water into its hydrogen and oxygen atoms. But I don&#x2019;t need any of that, do I?&#x201d; Although this seems a rhetorical question, several people are, in fact, shaking their heads. &#x201c;I just need someone who knows my books and has working index fingers to press a few buttons on my fax machine. Why on earth is this so hard&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&#x201d; He trails off before barking, &#x201c;Try again!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Walker. I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What in the fuck do you mean you don&#x2019;t know?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s very&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. unique.&#x201d; My mouth goes dry.<br> <br>Rene cringes when I say the word. He passes the joint George&#x2019;s way.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, looks like I have another moron on my hands. Where does Hans find these people?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d; I say.<br> <br>George pours himself another three fingers of scotch and takes the joint from Rene. It&#x2019;s jarring to watch George consume drugs like a cracked-out nickel whore. I mean, the man was once the state of Ohio and a heartbeat away from running the free world.<br> <br>&#x201c;Have you even read anything I&#x2019;ve ever written, missy? You and your stupid notebook.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course I have.&#x201d; Not only have I read all of Walker&#x2019;s early work, I have studied it extensively. You don&#x2019;t come of age in the 1980s as an aspiring writer without at least a passing familiarity with the oeuvre of Walker Reade. There had been a time, not long ago, when Walker Reade was not just a writer&#x2014;Walker Reade was a Writer Who Mattered. Regardless, I sense that this is perhaps the wrong moment to tell him Liar&#x2019;s Dice is what made me want to write, or that his radical social commentary altered my worldview. I tuck the notebook behind my back and try to casually hold my drink. Every move I make now feels conspicuous.<br> <br>&#x201c;You hate it,&#x201d; says Walker.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re going to be out here, you have to tell me the truth. That&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;re getting paid to do!&#x201d;<br> <br>I briefly consider reminding him that I&#x2019;m not getting paid anything until he officially hires me. This is my three-day trial period. Even if I survive this, I won&#x2019;t get paid until he delivers some real pages. That is what I&#x2019;ve been told the deal is.<br> <br>&#x201c;Walker, go easy. It&#x2019;s her first day,&#x201d; Claudia says.<br> <br>&#x201c;Walker, baby, let&#x2019;s go do something fun,&#x201d; says Devaney, popping up from the couch like a character in a musical. She passes the tray of coke to me.<br> <br>Walker ignores her, goes into the other room, and emerges with his seven books, every one a hardcover. He stacks them on the counter. Biker&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. bam! Liar&#x2019;s Dice&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. bam! Ship of Fools&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. bam! The Wake&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. bam! Crossroad&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. bam! Rabbit Hole&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. bam! Traffic&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. bam!<br> <br>&#x201c;To the cabin,&#x201d; he demands, pointing my way out the door. &#x201c;And don&#x2019;t come back over here till you&#x2019;ve read these&#x2014;no, memorized these.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And are you going to do that fucking line or what?&#x201d; I stare down at the tray of coke I&#x2019;ve been holding entirely too long for this crowd. I&#x2019;ve been a bartender for three years. I&#x2019;m a drinks girl, not a drugs girl. I&#x2019;m horribly ambivalent about the tray in front of me. Too ambivalent, I think, for this place. I pass the tray to Rene and attempt to scuttle over the back of the couch, thinking I&#x2019;ve just fucked this whole thing up in less than an hour. My shot. I grab the books, feeling hot down my neck, as I hold my head high&#x2014;as if my literary hero hasn&#x2019;t just called me an idiot&#x2014;and retire to my quarters.</p><h2>Unconventional Flying Objects: A Scientific Analysis</h2><p><p>Paul Hill was a well-respected NASA scientist when, in the early 1950s, he had a UFO sighting. Soon after, he built the first flying platform and was able to duplicate the UFO's tilt-to-control maneuvers. Official policy, however, prevented him from proclaiming his findings. "I was destined," says Hill, "to remain as unidentified as the flying objects."</p><p>For the next twenty-five years, Hill acted as an unofficial clearing house at NASA, collecting and analyzing sightings' reports for physical properties, propulsion possibilities, dynamics, etc. To refute claims that UFOs defy the laws of physics, he had to make "technological sense ... of the unconventional object."</p><p>After his retirement from NASA, Hill finally completed his remarkable analysis. In <em>Unconventional Flying Objects</em>, published posthumously, he presents his findings that UFOs "obey, not defy, the laws of physics." Vindicating his own sighting and thousands of others, he proves that UFO technology is not only explainable, but attainable.</p></p><p>Here is a book to intrigue both non-technical and more mechanically inclined UFO enthusiasts. Without making a case for the origins of UFOs, Hill argues that their functionality is feasible by applying established principles of physics to existing reports in which an amazingly consistent UFO behavior has been described. In language which is technically sound, but not so advanced that the layman could not understand, Hill works out several possible propulsion systems for these mysterious craft.&#34;Paul Hill has done a masterful job ferreting out the basic science and technology behind the elusive UFO characteristics . . . Perhaps this book will help bring solid consideration for making all that is known about extraterrestrial craft publicly available.&#34; --Edgar Mitchell, Sc.D., Apollo 14 Astronaut</p><h2>Elia Kazan: A Life</h2><p>The noted stage and film director and novelist recounts his long, eventful life--from Turkish boyhood to American success--and his career, sharing his experiences with other other stage and screen notables</p><p>One of the most important theater autobiographies of the 1980s, <i>Elia Kazan: A Life</i>, has finally been released in paperback. The extra decade adds to the book's poignancy and its value: a history of backstage personalities and politics in the 20th century is included in this release. Elia Kazan was a founding member of the Group Theatre, was among those shouting "Strike! Strike!" on the legendary opening night of <i>Waiting for Lefty</i>, directed the two greatest Broadway dramas ever--<i>Death of the Salesman</i> and <i>A Streetcar Named Desire</i>--and earned countless other credits, but he also played a flawed role in the greatest real-life moral drama of his era: the McCarthy Communist witch hunts of the 1950s. Kazan offered names to the House Un-American Activities Committee. He cut his conscience to fit the fashion of the time, and his conscience continues to bleed. Though this book is framed, like so much of Kazan's best stage and film work, as a lifelong search for man's proper relationship to society, the book serves as a massive explanation and apologia for Kazan's one monumental lapse. He lived his life intensely, a life in which a single word could transform you, where a misdeed might be "never forgotten or forgiven." Such were the times, and Kazan captures them with appropriate drama.<b>Elia Kazan's</b> work includes stage productions of <i>A Streetcar Named Desire, Death of a Salesman,</i> and <i>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</i> as well as films like <i>On the Waterfront, East of Eden</i>, and <i>Splendor in the Grass</i>. He is also the author of <i>The Arrangement, America America,</i> and <i>The Assassins</i>, among others.</p><h2>Key to the Name of the Rose (English and Latin Edition)</h2><p>Key To The Name Of The Rose, The by Haft, Adele J.

He was last spotted in Texas with his lovely three-eyed wife and twin Martians. This is his second book for earthlings.<p>Reviews From: </p><p>THE BULLETIN<br> PUBLISHERS WEEKLY<br> </p><p><b> of The Center for Children's Books<br> By Janice Harrington</b><br> When Frank (as in Frankenstein) goes dancing, his lively movements make him fall to pieces, whereupon his previously appreciative audience runs screaming from the theater. A humorous rhyming text immediately engages readers: "Frank was a monster who wanted to dance./ 'I know I could boogie if they gave me a chance.'/ So he put on his hat and his shoes made in France/ and opened a jar and put on his pants." In acrylic and colored pencil, Graves' cartoon-like illustrations, stylistically reminiscent of Lane Smith, extend the text with such details as Frank's mouse slippers (complete with teeth), a bottle of "Le Smell," and a box of "Le Shooz." Graves' palette (purple-grape, electric blue, and lime-green with cherry-red highlights) makes the details pop without overwhelming the eye. Young listeners will respond to the comedy, the catchy rhythm, and especially the yuck factor induced by Frank's dancy disintegration. </p><p><br> <b> </b>Newcomer Graves pays generic, goofy homage to <i>Frankenstein </i> &nbsp;and to 1960s-era hot-rod art. He goes heavy on the purple, electric blue and Astroturf green in his polished, nearly 3D compositions of acrylic and colored pencil. Even the hand-lettered text, with its occasional incorporation of worms, bulging eyes, etc., contributes to the expansion of the punchline, which will likely hit primary graders' funny bones. </p><p><br> <b> </b>In rhyme and gloriously putrid color, we follow Frank the monster as he achieves his dream: "I know I could boogie if they gave me a chance," he muses, sitting at home in his pants, and proceeds to the theater. The audience loves him, but his head, which looks like an acid-green baseball with a zipper, comes undone, spilling out his purplely brain. The grossed-out audience departs as Frank loses an arm and an eyeball. Just the ticket for a collection that might be leaning too much toward the sweet and proper. This is a close cousin to Boogi Bones, written by Elizabeth Loredo and illustrated by Kevin Hawkes. </p><p></p></p><h2>A Wreath of Snow: A Victorian Christmas Novella</h2><p><p><b>&nbsp;</b>&#x201c;A wonderful story of redemption and restoration that will warm your heart during the Christmas season&#x2014;or any time of year!&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Francine Rivers, </b>best-selling author of<i> Redeeming Love</i></p><p>Wrapped in a cloud of steam, the engine rolled to a stop, the screech of metal against metal filling the frosty air.

Why had she not consulted her father&#x2019;s railway schedule posted by the kitchen door? Because she left Albert Place in tears. Because she left without even saying good-bye.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meg lowered her chin lest a gust of wind catch the brim of her hat and wrench it from her head. Another minute and she would reach the corner. Two minutes more and&#x2014;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Mind where you&#x2019;re going, lass!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Startled, she nearly lost her balance on the icy pavement.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Beg pardon, Mr. Fenwick.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her former schoolteacher, now bent with age, merely grunted in response.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Miss Campbell,&#x201d; she reminded him, knowing how many students had passed through his classroom door. &#x201c;Have you heard that I&#x2019;m a teacher now? In Edinburgh?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Aye.&#x201d; He stared at her for a moment, then tottered off without another word, the tip of his cane drawing a jagged pattern in the snow.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meg turned away, slightly stung by the elderly man&#x2019;s rebuff. Perhaps Mr. Fenwick believed unmarried women should reside at home with their families. If so, he was not alone in his opinion. But he didn&#x2019;t know what life was like beneath her parents&#x2019; roof. I tried to stay, Mum. Truly I did.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gripping her leather satchel, Meg headed toward Station Road, glancing at the shop windows with their mounds of fresh oranges and brightly colored paper bells. Her two dozen students would be home by now, celebrating Christmas with their loved ones. Just picturing bright-eyed Eliza Grant holding up her chalk slate covered with numbers and Jamie McFarlane shouting out the alphabet with glee renewed Meg&#x2019;s confidence. She was living in the right place and doing the work she was called to do, no matter what the Mr. Fenwicks of the world might think.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The heavy snowfall muted the clatter of horses&#x2019; hoofs in the busy thoroughfare and washed every bit of color from the sky. Was it two o&#x2019;clock? Three? She&#x2019;d been so upset when she left her parents&#x2019; house that she hadn&#x2019;t checked the watch pinned to her bodice or arranged for a carriage. Now she had to send for her trunk and hope it could be delivered to the railway station in time for her departure.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She turned the corner and was relieved to see a host of arriving passengers pouring into the street. It seemed the trains were running despite the weather. Easing her pace to manage the downward slope, Meg held out one hand, prepared to grasp a hitching post&#x2014;or a stranger&#x2019;s elbow, if need be.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Few pedestrians were moving in the direction she was. Instead, they were flowing upward into the town. Gentlemen returning home from the city, cousins gathering for Christmas, young scholars toting ice skates instead of books&#x2014;all were tramping up snowy Station Road with joy on their faces. Guilt, as sharp as the wintry wind, swept over Meg. Her<br>parents had looked anything but joyful when she&#x2019;d quit Albert Place. Her brother, Alan, was the reason she&#x2019;d left, yet Meg had hurt her father and mother all the same. &#x201c;Forgive me,&#x201d; she whispered, wishing she&#x2019;d said those words earlier.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For two long years she&#x2019;d avoided a visit home, praying time might dislodge the bitterness that had taken root in her brother&#x2019;s heart. But when she&#x2019;d arrived in Stirling last evening, she&#x2019;d discovered the sad truth. Alan Campbell, four years her junior, was even more churlish and demanding than she&#x2019;d remembered and greedy as well, a new and unwelcome affliction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His parting words would follow her back to Edinburgh&#x2014;to Thistle Street, to Aunt Jean&#x2019;s house, to her house. &#x201c;What a selfish creature you are, Meg.&#x201d; She flinched even now, remembering the cruel look on her brother&#x2019;s face and the sharpness of his tone. &#x201c;You could have sold the house Aunt Jean gave you and shared the earnings with your family.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>You mean with you, Alan.<br></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meg lifted the hem of her coat and stepped with care through the slush and dirt the horse-drawn carriages left behind. She could hardly deny Alan&#x2019;s needs were greater than her own. But when she&#x2019;d moved to Edinburgh to care for their late aunt, wrapping her aching limbs with compresses and feeding her bowls of hot soup, Meg had never imagined Aunt Jean would choose to bless her only niece with the gift of her town house.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Father should have been her heir,&#x201d; Alan had insisted. Aunt Jean&#x2019;s will, written in her neat hand, stated otherwise.<br>Over the midday meal Meg&#x2019;s conversation with her brother had deteriorated into thinly veiled accusations on his part and tearful denials on hers, until she could bear no more. To be treated so unkindly, and on Christmas Eve! Her parents had tried to intervene, but Alan&#x2019;s temper was not easily managed. Their patience with him was a testimony to their Christian charity. And to their love, though Meg wondered if guilt did not play an equal role.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meg wove through the crowd and kept her head down lest someone recognize her and draw her into a discussion. Much as it grieved her, she had no polite banter to offer, no cheerful holiday sentiments. By tomorrow her mood would surely brighten. Just now she wished to tend her wounds in private. She stepped across the threshold into the railway station and brushed off the snow that clung to her coat, glad to be out of the wind. Inside the nearby booking office a cast-iron stove glowed with heat, steaming up the windows. But in the waiting area and across the broad, open platform, winter prevailed. Holly wreaths, their crimson berries bright against the dark green leaves, decorated the painted iron pillars supporting the roof. Everyone&#x2019;s arms were filled with packages, as if Saint Nicholas had already come and gone. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meg glanced at the clock mounted below the arched ceiling, then scanned the departure times posted for the Caledonian Railway. The southbound line, which stopped at Larbert, Falkirk, and Linlithgow en route to Edinburgh, departed at three twenty-six. Little more than an hour remained to collect her baggage.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a middle-aged porter lumbered past, bearing a trunk far larger than her own, Meg hurried after him. &#x201c;Sir, might I engage your services?&#x201d; As he swung around with an expectant look on his face, she paused, her resolve flagging. How might her family respond when a porter asked for her belongings? Her mother would surely burst into tears. And her brother? He would probably want the contents of her trunk tossed into the street.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Determined not to lose heart, Meg reached for the small coin purse inside her satchel. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve a single trunk to be transported from Albert Place onto the next train bound for Edinburgh,&#x201d; she told the porter. She then informed him of the address and offered enough silver to guarantee his cooperation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I know the house, miss.&#x201d; The coins disappeared into his pocket. &#x201c;Soon as I deliver this trunk, I&#x2019;ll see to yours.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She sent him on his way, glancing up at the clock, hoping he would catch her meaning. <i>Hurry, hurry.<br></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The queue at the booking window was blessedly short. Before she could join the handful of outbound travelers waiting to purchase tickets, a small dog appeared and began nipping at the hem of her coat. &#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you a fine wee pup?&#x201d; she murmured, bending down to stroke the young terrier. Even through her gloves she could feel his wiry coat and the light nip of his teeth as he playfully turned his head this way and that.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the din floated a high, reedy voice. &#x201c;Can it be Miss Campbell come back at last?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edith Darroch. Of all the gossips in Stirling, she took the prize.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meg slowly rose to face the woman, who served up savory news and idle rumors like a hostess offering scones and jam. Though Edith&#x2019;s hair had faded to the color of ashes, her eyes were bright with interest.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Mrs. Darroch,&#x201d; Meg said. &#x201c;Are you bound for Alloa to spend Christmas with your son?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Indeed not.&#x201d; The older woman gave her terrier&#x2019;s leash a swift tug. &#x201c;Johnny is returning home for the holidays, as any loving child should do. I expect him on the next train.&#x201d; After a cursory glance about the station, she asked, &#x201c;Is your family not here to greet you?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question pierced Meg&#x2019;s heart. Her parents had met her train last evening. But on this bitterly cold afternoon, she was very much on her own.</p><h2>The Heroes</h2><p>They say Black Dow's killed more men than winter, and clawed his way to the throne of the North up a hill of skulls. The King of the Union, ever a jealous neighbor, is not about to stand smiling by while he claws his way any higher. The orders have been given and the armies are toiling through the northern mud. Thousands of men are converging on a forgotten ring of stones, on a worthless hill, in an unimportant valley, and they've brought a lot of sharpened metal with them.<br><br>THE HEROES<br><br>For glory, for victory, for staying alive.</p><p>Joe Abercrombie is the <em>Sunday Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Best Served Cold</em> and the First Law trilogy: <em>The Blade Itself, Before They Are Hanged,</em>and<em> Last Argument of Kings</em>. He is a full time writer, and occasional freelance film editor, who lives in Bath, England with his wife and daughters. Find out more about Joe Abercrombie atwww.joeabercrombie.com.When hes not writing large-scale fantasy novels, Abercrombie moonlights as a freelance film editor, a skill that undoubtedly contributes to his forte of crafting cinematically vivid action and crisp, witty dialogue. His latest novel revisits territory well trodden in his First Law trilogy, which opened with The Blade Itself (2006), and traverses an imaginary landscape reminiscent of a medieval Europe populated by citizens of the Union Empire and its tribal enemies to the north. Here the story concentrates on a sometimes violent, sometimes bafflingly strange three-day battle taking place on and around an insignificant Northlands hill crowned by monolithic burial stones called The Heroes. While the battle looms as only one stepping stone in a larger campaign by the Unions Lord Marshal Kroy in preventing the Norths Black Dow from seizing more lands, the clash of key adversaries will prove decisive. Yet the premise here is less important than the multiple political intrigues, scandals, and jealous feuds enacted by Abercrombies parade of colorful characters. One of Abercrombies most masterfully executed and compellingly readable novels to date. --Carl Hays</p><h2>UCSMP Geometry (University of Chicago School Mathematics Project)</h2><p>Student hardcover textbook, 2nd edition</p><p></p><h2>Dark Canyon Louis Lamour Collection</h2><p>ASIN: 0553062417 Product Name: Dark Canyon Louis Lamour Collection Category (item-type): books Marketplace: US</p><p></p><h2>The Zen of Creative Painting: An Elegant Design for Revealing your Muse</h2><p>By the author of <i>The Tao of Watercolor</i>, this book, the second in her &#x201c;Path of Painting&#x201d; series, offers creative artists of all levels empowering guidance based on Zen principles.</p><p>Creativity is one of the great mysteries of life. Everyone may possess it to some degree, but why do some people seem completely in touch with their creative powers while others struggle to connect with it at all? How do you unlock your creative potential--or maximize it, if you're already utilizing some level of it? This inspirational book--meant primarily for painters but full of sage advice for other types of artists and crafters, too--teaches how to release your muse by exploring the basics of the language of art and by applying the Zen principles of blending body, mind, and spirit and of following an intuitive rather than purely logical approach. The author's own lyrical, vividly colored paintings (as well as works by other artists) complement her highly readable discussions of self-awareness, instinct, mandalas, harmony, and mindfulness, as both important general concepts and as they pertain to landscape, still life, and figural art. In short, she teaches you how to know yourself as a creator, and to recognize that "creative vision really is your natural birthright" and that "art has something to offer everyone ... as a means of self-knowledge." <i>--Amy Handy</i>Inspiration may be the most important element in the psyche of an artist. These volumes represent three widely different sources of inspiration, one from the spiritual world of Zen, another from the personal guidance of an accomplished mentor, and the last from the wildest reaches of the imagination. Carbonetti had a surprise hit with her first book, The Tao of Watercolor. This one may also find a wide audience, despite its rather superficial use of Zen. It is a bold attempt, but those seriously interested in Eastern religion as artistic inspiration will be disappointed. Howard is a master of light in both watercolor and oil. Appointed Official Artist in Northern Ireland and a member of the Royal Academy, he is a stimulating teacher with strong views. Going from the sublime to the hideous, Jefferies's book on fantasy art will either stimulate the imagination or provoke nightmares. His is one of the best manuals for creating beasts, angels, demons, wizards, and cursed castles. He even gives tips on making maps for lands where your creatures can roam. Three good volumes, each sure to find an audience. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Discovery!: The Search for Arabian Oil</h2><p>Illuminating a little-known but extremely significant period in world history&#x2014;the discovery of oil in the Middle East and the beginnings of what is now the Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco)&#x2014;this captivating history explores the birth of the Middle Eastern oil industry. From the king and his royal court to the desert guides, scientists, and mechanics who built the original oil company, Aramco, the distant and desperately poor world of Depression-era Saudi Arabia is vividly brought to life. Written more than 50 years ago, this detailed account serves as a kind of time capsule and features the author&#x2019;s prescient insights into the cultural and technological consequences of King Ibn Saud&#x2019;s deliberate decision to choose America as his commercial ally.</p><p><b>Wallace Stegner</b> is the author of more than 30 books, including the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning&nbsp;<i>Angle of Repose</i>. He established the creative writing program at Stanford University in 1945. <b>Thomas W. Lippman</b> is&nbsp;an adjunct scholar at the Middle East Institute. He is the author of <i>Egypt After Nasser</i>, <i>Inside the Mirage: America's Fragile Partnership with Saudi Arabia</i>,<i> Madeline Albright and the New American Diplomacy</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Understanding Islam.</i> He has traveled extensively in Saudi Arabia as a reporter and diplomat on behalf of the&nbsp;<i>Washington Post.</i> He lives in Washington, DC.An undistinguished writing professor at Stanford when he was commissioned by the Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco) in 1955 to write "an approved history of the oil venture's early days," future Pulitzer Prize-winner Stegner (1909-1993) makes a fabulous tale out of what could have been a sterile (or sycophantic) history of the early years of Middle Eastern oil drilling, replete with Texas wildcatters, British nobility, Bedouin raiders and Saudi princes. After initial negotiations between Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud and the Standard Oil Company of California, which had an odd hunch that oil might be found in King Saud's barren, backward land, Stegner chronicles the construction of the first wells (which, strangely, produced disappointing yields), the political and corporate skirmishes (with occasional bombing) that followed, World War II and the end of the "frontier" in 1945. Though one wonders at the verisimilitude of the writing (many accounts fit quite neatly into Stegner's world, a folksy blend of Mark Twain and Ogden Nash where "a breed loud, tough, strong, rowdy, good-natured, and superbly adapted" safeguard the outposts of civilization), a notable lack of corporate boosterism (which apparently led Aramco to bury it) gives the account a veneer of honesty. Published for the first time in the U.S., this account should prove fascinating for historians, industry insiders and anyone who wants a closer look at the source of their last fill-up. 16 pages of b&amp;w photos. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

(1976) Paperback</h2><p>As Lippard points out, Hesse s use of obsessive repetition in her works served to increase and exaggerate the absurdity she saw in her life. In many ways, her works were psychic models, as Robert Smithson has said, of a very interior person. In pioneering the use of soft materials, her sculptures betrayed her awareness of the manner in which her experience as a woman altered her art and career. Although she died before feminism affected the art world to any great extent, her major works have since become talismans for succeeding generations of women artists.Eva Hesse was designed by Hesse s friends and colleagues Sol LeWitt and Pat Stier; her sculptures, drawings, and paintings are reproduced and discussed; and the text includes numerous quotations from her diaries.

For White, each momentous occasion came with a book to match: Proust's <i>Remembrance of Things Past</i>, which opened up the seemingly closed world of homosexuality while he was at boarding school in Michigan; the Ezra Pound poems adored by a lover he followed to New York; the biography of Stephen Crane that inspired one of White's novels. But it wasn't until heart surgery in 2014, when he temporarily lost his desire to read, that White realized the key role that reading played in his life: forming his tastes, shaping his memories, and amusing him through the best and worst life had to offer.</p><p>Blending memoir and literary criticism, <i>The Unpunished Vice </i>is a compendium of all the ways reading has shaped White's life and work. His larger-than-life presence on the literary scene lends itself to fascinating, intimate insights into the lives of some of the world's best-loved cultural figures. With characteristic wit and candor, he recalls reading Henry James to Peggy Guggenheim in her private gondola in Venice and phone calls at eight o'clock in the morning to Vladimir Nabokov--who once said that White was his favorite American writer.</p><p>Featuring writing that has appeared in the<i> New York Review of Books</i> and the<i> Paris Review</i>, among others, <i>The Unpunished Vice </i>is a wickedly smart and insightful account of a life in literature.</p></p><p><b>Edmund White</b> is the author of many novels, including <i>A Boy's Own Story</i>,<i> The Beautiful Room Is Empty</i>,<i> The Farewell Symphony</i>, and, most recently, <i>Our Young Man</i>. His nonfiction includes <i>City Boy</i>,<i> Inside a Pearl</i>, and other memoirs; <i>The Fl�neur</i>, about Paris; and literary biographies and essays. White lives in New York.<p>"<i>The Unpunished Vice</i> pulls together [White's] lived life and his reading life; what he cares about is giving the readers a sense of some of the authors he has enjoyed the most, and from whom he has learned the most . . . [For White] reading was a transgression against the norm, to be pursued in private, to be enjoyed for the pleasure of the story and the guilt of reading it." - <i>Jane Smiley, New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>"White's reflections are just as lucid as they are fascinating and just as compelling as they are bountiful. A literary delicacy with more takeaways than one can count." - <i>Starred review, Kirkus</i></p><p>"In this m�lange of essay and memoir, author White (<i>Our Young Man</i>) reflects on the books and people that helped shape his remarkable literary life . . . In a conversational tone that blends affirmation and elegy, White escorts readers through an impressive range of interests and experiences . . . this collection is like a heartfelt conversation with friends over a bottle of wine." - <i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"A generous, lovely book about the profound effect of reading on a versatile and influential writer." - <i>Booklist</i></p><p>"The delightful thing about [<i>The Unpunished Vice</i>] is the way White&#x2019;s personal adventures and omnivorous reading habits intersect." - <i>Chicago Tribune</i></p><p>"In this blend of memoir and literary criticism, author White writes about his lifelong love of reading. In the book's postface, he relates being chastised as a young child for not yet having learned to read, a skill he equated with freedom. Using his life and experiences, the author creates a literary memoir about this "lonely and intensely sociable act." His tastes are eclectic and wide ranging; he argues that Leo Tolstoy's <i>Anna Karenina</i> is "the greatest novel in all literature," placing this and other works within the context of his own life and the time and place in which the book was published. VERDICT: A lovely and thoughtful memoir about reading, books, and life." - <i>Starred review, Library Journal</i></p><p>"[White's] work is as varied as it is unmistakably his.

White is above all else a writer's writer: one of the great prose stylists of our time." - <i>Tim Smith-Laing, Daily Telegraph</i></p><p>"White is a charming and sharp-witted raconteur worth spending time with on the page. <i>The Unpunished Vice</i> is a welcome capstone to the venerable literary career of a writer who has never been afraid to expose his own and others' fallibility." - <i>BookPage</i></p><p>"White is the preeminent gay man of letters of our time." - <i>Bay Area Reporter</i></p><p>"You likely don't think reading is sexy or transgressive. But you will after dipping into <i>The Unpunished Vice</i> by Edmund White. The word iconic is an overused cliche. Yet, there's no other way to describe White, 78, our most eminent queer writer." - <i>Washington Blade</i></p><p>"Edmund White is <b>one of the best writers of my generation</b>; he's certainly the contemporary American writer I reread more than any other, and the one whose next book I look forward to reading most" - <i>John Irving</i></p><p>"Edmund White tells such a good story that <b>I'm ready to to listen to anything he wants to talk about</b>" - <i>New York Times on THE FLANEUR</i></p><p>"White&#x2019;s prose is as fresh as a series of slaps to the face." - <i>The New York Times Book Review on OUR YOUNG MAN</i></p><p>"White has proven himself again and again to be one of the finest storytellers of his generation . . .

That's because a good short story crosses the borders of our nations and our prejudices and our beliefs."<br><br>Dorothy Allison Edwidge Danticat E. L. Doctorow Louise Erdrich Adam Haslett ZZ Packer Mona Simpson Mary Yukari Waters</p><p>Walter Mosley is the award-winning author of the story collection Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned and its sequel, Walkin&#x2019; the Dog, as well as five Easy Rawlins mysteries. His novel RJ&#x2019;s Dream was a finalist for the NAACP Award in Fiction.Introduction: Americans Dreaming<br><br>Whenever anyone asks my opinion about the difference between novels and <br>short stories, I tell them that there is no distinction between the genres. They <br>are essentially the same thing, I always reply.<br> How can you say that? the fiction lover asks. Stories are small <br>gems, perfectly cut to expose every facet of an idea, which is in turn <br>illuminated by ten thousand tiny shafts of light.<br> But I hold my ground, answering the metaphor with a simile. A <br>novel, I say, is like a mountain &#x2014; superior, vast, and immense. Its apex is in <br>the clouds and it appears to us as a higher being &#x2014; a divinity. Mountains <br>loom and challenge; they contain myriad life forms and cannot be seen by <br>anyone attempting the climb. Mountains can be understood only by years of <br>negotiating their trails and sheer faces. They contain a wide variety of <br>atmospheres and are complex and immortal.<br> You cannot approach a mountain unless you are completely <br>prepared for the challenge. In much the same way, you can"t begin to read <br>(or write) a novel without attempting to embrace a life much larger than the <br>range of any singular human experience.<br> Thinking in this way, I understand the mountain and the novel to <br>be impossible in everyday human terms. Both emerge from a distance that <br>can be approached only by faith. And when you get there, all you find is <br>yourself. The beauty or terror you experience is your understanding of how far <br>you"ve come, your being stretched further than is humanly possible.<br> The fiction lover agrees. She says, Yes, of course. The novel is a <br>large thing. The novel stands against the backdrop of human existence just <br>as mountains dominate the landscape. But stories are simple things, small <br>aspects of human foibles and quirks. A story can be held in a glance or a half-<br>remembered dream.<br> It"s a good argument, and I wouldn"t refute it. But I will say that if <br>novels are mountains, then stories are far-flung islands that one comes upon <br>in the limitless horizon of the sea. Not big islands like Hawaii, but small, <br>craggy atolls inhabited by eclectic and nomadic life forms that found their <br>way there in spite of tremendous odds. One of these small islets can be fully <br>explored in a few hours. There"s a grotto, a sandy beach, a new species of <br>wolf spider, and maybe the remnants of an ancient culture that came here <br>and moved on or, possibly, just died out.<br> These geologic comparisons would seem to support the fiction <br>reader"s claim that novels and short stories are different categories, distant <br>cousins in the linguistic universe. But where did those wolf spiders come <br>from? And who were the people who came here and died? And why, when I <br>walk around this footprint of land, do I feel that something new arises with <br>each day? I eat fish that live in the caves below the waves. I see dark <br>shadows down there. I dream of the firmament that lies below the ocean, the <br>mountain that holds up that small span of land.<br> I cannot climb the mountain that sits in the sea, but from where I <br>stand it comes to me in detritus and dreams.<br> Short story writers must be confident of that suboceanic mountain <br>in order to place their tale in the world. After all, fiction mostly resides in the <br>imagination of the reader. All the writer can do is hint at a world that calls <br>forth the dream, telling the story that exhorts us to call the possibility into <br>being.<br> The writers represented in this collection have told stories that <br>suggest much larger ideas. I found myself presented with the challenge of <br>simple human love contrasted against structures as large as religion and <br>death. The desire to be loved or to be seen, represented on a canvas so <br>broad that it would take years to explain all the roots that bring us to the <br>resolution.<br> In many of the stories we find exiles, people who have lost their <br>loved ones, their homelands, their way. These stories are simple and <br>exquisite, but they aren"t merely tales of personal loss. Mothers have left us <br>long before the mountains were shifted by southward-moving ice floes. Men <br>have been broken by their dreams for almost as long as the continents have <br>been drifting. And every day someone opens her eyes and sees a world that <br>she never expected could be there.<br> These short stories are vast structures existing mostly in the <br>subconscious of our cultural history. They will live with the reader long after <br>the words have been translated into ideas and dreams. That"s because a <br>good short story crosses the borders of our nations and our prejudices and <br>our beliefs. A good short story asks a question that can"t be answered in <br>simple terms. And even if we come up with some understanding, years later, <br>while glancing out of a window, the story still has the potential to return, to <br>alter right there in our mind and change everything.<br><br>&#x2014;Walter Mosley<br><br>Copyright � 2003 by Houghton Mif&#xfb02;in Company.

At the center of the scandal is the isolated, insulated winter home of the mega wealthy. Suddenly, everyone in America is talking about the South Florida island and the rarified life so apart from the rest of America. Everyone wants to know what are the deepest truths of this strange, exotic universe of wealth and privilege. </p> <p>In <i>Madness Under the Royal Palms</i>, Laurence Leamer has the answers. It took him fifteen years to get them, and to expose the inner life and drama of the wealthy as it has never been exposed before. It is an often shocking, scandalous book that will forever change not only the way Palm Beach is viewed but the life of wealth and privilege in America.</p> <p>Leave it to Leamer, the bestselling author known for getting the inside story on his elusive subjects, to take us behind the walls of America&#x2019;s most exclusive enclave of wealth and privilege. In <i>Madness</i>, Leamer tells a braided story involving a socialite determined to make it to the top of Palm Beach society, two infamous murders, and a powerful society reporter. As a backdrop, Leamer tells the story of the clash between old money and new, religion and status, and the love, lust, and fatal hatreds that determine the shape of a fiercely protected society. The cast of characters include trophy wives, trophy husbands, purported gigolos, glamorous widows, a pioneering gay couple, a wildly irreverent event planner, a sociopathic multimillionaire, and an elegant society queen.</p> <p>For a hundred years Palm Beach has been a fantasy land nurtured by, and maintained for, the megawealthy. In the end, Leamer&#x2019;s tale of money, murder and mad pretension reveals a darker strain. Uncovering that strain, as the author himself writes, &#x201c;turned into as fascinating, in some cases as shocking, and always as unexpected a journey as I have ever taken.&#x201d;</p></p><p><b> Guest Reviewer: Meryl Gordon, Author of <i>Mrs. Astor Regrets</i></b><p></p> Just the name--Palm Beach--conjures up an American fantasy of wealth, privilege and exclusivity. Laurence Leamer, in his well-written and entertaining new book, <i>Madness Under the Royal Palms,</i> offers up an inside look at this playground of the rich, and its under-class of social-climbing wannabes. Tracing the history of Palm Beach and its magnificent real estate, describing the fabulous parties, investigating some of the city's sordid secrets, Leamer's book provides a memorable, and at times haunting, portrayal of high society at a moment of transition, where things are often not what they seem.Laurence Leamer is the author of thirteen books, including <i>The Kennedy Women</i> and <i>Fantastic: The Life of Arnold Schwarzenegger</i>, with many bestsellers among them. Leamer was on the staff at <i>Newsweek</i> and has written for <i>The New York Times Magazine, Harper's, Playboy</i>, and many other publications. He lives in Palm Beach and Washington, D.C.</p><h2>Fantastic architecture: Personal and eccentric visions</h2><p>First edition bound in yellow cloth. Illustrated through-out, 247 pages, 4to.

We've got to pay for them, wear them, and then find a spot for them in the back of the closet. Our best women friends, suddenly transformed into tasteful-white-dress-wearing brides, tell us, "You'll be able to wear <em>this</em> bridesmaid dress again." But we know better.<p><em>101 Uses for a Bridesmaid Dress,</em> tongue firmly in cheek, pokes fun at the hopelessly horrible dress that a bride asks her "court" to don. These whimsical illustrations and silly suggestions, from cocktail napkins and shower curtains, to pony blankets and frilly jock straps, are a hilarious antidote to the bridesmaid dresses we'll <em>never</em> wear again. </p><p></p></p><p><p>Cindy Walker is a model, actress, and accomplished equestrian.

She lives with her husband and their son in Manhattan. </p>"This book is so much fun! Each suggestion about how to recycle a bridesmaid dress, from turning it into a taffeta hammock to using it as a beekeeper outfit, is hilarious. And the illustrations are totally charming. Give it to your bridesmaids to cheer them up!" -- Lois Smith Brady, author of Vows -- <i>the book and New York Times Sunday column</i></p><h2>Aran Knitting</h2><p>Packed with color and design, this significant book presents a complete Alice Starmore workshop in Aran Knitting.Step-by-step instructions, photos and drawings lead readers through 60 charted patterns that progress from the basic concepts of using a cable needle to the myriad variations of Aran technique.It includes 14 original Alice Starmore designs, and celtic knotwork.</p><p>Alice Starmore&#39;s definitive explanation of an Irish Aran sweater and its development is surprising and fascinating. Arans are not ancient, and--contrary to popular legend--they were not developed as fishermen&#39;s garments. Starmore offers fairly convincing evidence that &#34;true&#34; Aran sweaters were adapted in this century from Scottish fishing ganseys. They are unarguably warm, practical, and beautiful, and here they are gorgeously photographed. Starmore, one of the knitting world&#39;s living treasures, includes specific cable patterns, patterns for 14 garments (both Aran and Celtic-style), and a clear, sensible guide to designing original Aran sweaters.A native of the Hebrides, Starmore is known internationally as a knitwear designer, teacher, and the author of a number of critically acclaimed knitting books. Here she sets off to examine aran knitting, its origins and history, and the techniques used to produce the richly cabled sweaters that are enjoying a renewed popularity among today's knitters. This book can be enjoyed on three levels: as a history of aran knitting, as a complete 14-lesson workshop on knitting aran patterns from charts, or as a collection of Starmore's original sweater, cap, and shawl designs, including full instructions and charted patterns. The garments, photographed on location in the Aran Islands, are inspirational fare for all knitters, while Starmore's designs will be of special interest to the more experienced.

Born in England and brought up in the household of the Earl of Lincoln where her father, Thomas Dudley, was steward, Anne Bradstreet sailed to Massachusetts Bay in 1630, shortly after her marriage at sixteen to Simon Bradstreet. For the next forty years she lived in the New England wilderness, raising a family of eight, combating sickness and hardship, and writing the verse that made her, as the poet Adrienne Rich says in her Foreword to this edition, "the first non-didactic American poet, the first to give an embodiment to American nature, the first in whom personal intention appears to precede Puritan dogma as an impulse to verse." </p><p> All Anne Bradstreet's extant poetry and prose is published here with modernized spelling and punctuation. This volume reproduces the second edition of <i>Several Poems</i>, brought out in Boston in 1678, as well as the contents of a manuscript first printed in 1857. Adrienne Rich's Foreword offers a sensitive and illuminating critique of Anne Bradstreet both as a person and as a writer, and the Introduction, scholarly notes, and appendices by Jeannine Hensley make this an authoritative edition. </p><p> Adrienne Rich observes, "Intellectual intensity among women gave cause for uneasiness" at this period--a fact borne out by the lines in the Prologue to the early poems: "I am obnoxious to each carping tongue/ Who says my hand a needle better fits." The broad scope of Anne Bradstreet's own learning and reading is most evident in the literary and historical allusions of <i>The Tenth Muse</i>, the first edition of her poems, published in London in 1650. Her later verse and her prose meditations strike a more personal note, however, and reveal both a passionate religious sense and a depth of feeling for her husband, her children, the fears and disappointments she constantly faced, and the consoling power of nature. Imbued with a Puritan striving to turn all events to the glory of God, these writings bear the mark of a woman of strong spirit, charm, delicacy, and wit: in their intimate and meditative quality Anne Bradstreet is established as a poet of sensibility and permanent stature.</p></p><p><b>Jeannine Hensley</b> is former Assistant Professor of English at Wheaton College, Norton, Massachusetts.</p><h2>Electronic Formulas, Symbols &amp; Circuits</h2><p>This Engineer's Mini Notebook provides a complete, basic electronics reference guide for the workshop, electronics hobbyist experimenter, or ham radio shack.

With it, author Truman Capote contributed to a style of writing in which the reporter gets so far inside the subject, becomes so familiar, that he projects events and conversations as if he were really there. The style has probably never been accomplished better than in this book. Capote combined painstaking research with a narrative feel to produce one of the most spellbinding stories ever put on the page. Two two-time losers living in a lonely house in western Kansas are out to make the heist of their life, but when things don't go as planned, the robbery turns ugly. From there, the book is a real-life look into murder, prison, and the criminal mind.On November 15, 1959, in the small town of Holcomb, Kansas, four members of the Clutter family were savagely murdered by blasts from a shotgun held a few inches from their faces. There was no apparent motive for the crime, and there were almost no clues. <br>Five years, four months and twenty-nine days later, on April 14, 1965, Richard Eugene Hickock, aged thirty-three, and Perry Edward Smith, aged thirty-six, were hanged from the crime on a gallows in a warehouse in the Kansas State Penitentiary in Lansing, Kansa. <br>In Cold Blood is the story of the lives and deaths of these six people. It has already been hailed as a masterpiece.</p><h2>Familiar Trees of North America : East</h2><p><b>A portable, comprehensive field guide--brimming with concise descriptions and stunning color photographs, and designed to fit into your back pocket--from the go-to reference source for over 18 million nature lovers.<br></b><br>This handy, streamlined field guide identifies the most frequently encountered trees of North America's eastern region.

The amiable narrator, A Square, provides an overview of this fantastic world&#x2014;its physics and metaphysics, its history, customs and religious beliefs. But when a strange visitor mysteriously appears and transports the incredulous Flatlander to the Land of Three Dimensions, his world view is forever shattered. Written more than a century ago, <i>Flatland</i> conceals within its brilliant parody of Victorian society speculations about the universe that resonate in Einstein&#x2019;s theory of relativity as well as the current &#x201c;string-theory&#x201d; of nature.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Readers trust the&nbsp;series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date&nbsp;translations by award-winning translators.</p><p><i>Flatland</i> is one of the very few novels about math and philosophy that can appeal to almost any layperson. Published in 1880, this short fantasy takes us to a completely flat world of two physical dimensions where all the inhabitants are geometric shapes, and who think the planar world of length and width that they know is all there is. But one inhabitant discovers the existence of a third physical dimension, enabling him to finally grasp the concept of a fourth dimension. Watching our Flatland narrator, we begin to get an idea of the limitations of our own assumptions about reality, and we start to learn how to think about the confusing problem of higher dimensions. The book is also quite a funny satire on society and class distinctions of Victorian England.<p> <em>Flatland</em> (1884) is an influential mathematical fantasy that simultaneously provides an introduction to non-Euclidean geometry and a satire on the Victorian class structure, issues of science and faith, and the role of women. A classic of early science fiction, the novel takes place in a world of two dimensions where all the characters are geometric shapes. The narrator, A Square, is a na�ve, respectable citizen who is faced with proof of the existence of three dimensions when he is visited by a sphere and is forced to see the limitations of his world. </p> <p> The introduction to this Broadview Edition provides context for the book&#x2019;s references to Victorian culture and religion, mathematical history, and the history of philosophy.

In 1985, when the author is just 12 years old, a suspicious fire decimates Greenwood's cotton crop and threatens many of the townsfolk's livelihoods. Local teen Tommy Moore is caught in the field with an incriminatingly lit cigarette, and his savage beating by a descendant of the community's largest landowning family kicks off a tragic cycle of retribution that exacerbates longstanding conflicts amongst the people of Greenwood. Drawing from memory, interviews, and town legend, Jones acknowledges that he's an unreliable narrator, and that his story is "piecemeal, secondhand, polluted, cleaned-up then tore down." The book is an ambitious hybrid of fact and myth, past and present, that calls into question the nature of truth itself. While its sprawling web of characters and story lines may seem convoluted at times, the novel is unified by Jones's rhythmic prose and his evident compassion for his former neighbors' tragedies--both personal and pastoral.

Her jumping-off points might be statistics, romance, the art world&#x2019;s piranha tank, games of chance and games of skill, the travails of publishing, or success. &#x201c;Look,&#x201d; a character begins to explain, laying out some gambit reasonably enough, even if facing a world of boomeranging counterfactuals, situations spinning out to their utmost logical extremes, and Rube Goldberg-like moving parts, where things prove &#x201c;more complicated than they had first appeared&#x201d; and &#x201c;at 3 a.m. the circumstances seem to attenuate.&#x201d; In various ways, each tale carries DeWitt&#x2019;s signature poker-face lament regarding the near-impossibility of the life of the mind when one is made to pay to have the time for it, in a world so sadly &#x201c;taken up with all sorts of paraphernalia superfluous, not to say impedimental, to ratiocination.&#x201d;</p><p>Author of The Last Samurai and Lightning Rods, &#x201c;Helen Dewitt knows, in descending order of proficiency, Latin, ancient Greek, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, Arabic, Hebrew, and Japanese: &#x2018;The self is a set of linguistic patterns,&#x2019; she said. &#x2018;Reading and speaking in another language is like stepping into an alternate history of yourself where all the bad connotations are gone&#x2019; (New York Magazine).&#x201d;&#x201c;DeWitt&#x2019;s bracing experiments are risks worth taking.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Madeleine Schwartz, <em>Dissent</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Brilliant and inimitable Helen DeWitt: patron saint of anyone in the world who has to deal with the crap of those in power who do a terrible job with their power, and who make those who are under their power utterly miserable.&nbsp;Certain stories have something in common with dreams: they&#x2019;re expressions of the creator&#x2019;s wish-fulfillment. Helen DeWitt&#x2019;s wishes are distinct in American literature?&#x2015;?in world literature, as far as I know.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Sheila Heti, <em>Electric Literature</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;If there's any author bookish types trust to take them down the twistiest of rabbit holes with humor and winking unpredictability, Helen DeWitt is it. Take the plunge with these 13 short stories.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Elle Magazine</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In this new collection, DeWitt maps a rangy and verbose urban landscape populated by couch surfers, VC bros, underpaid artists, a guitarist on a walkabout, mathematicians, two seemingly different guys named Gil, obscure European novelists and an itinerant heiress fluent in the tinkering grammars of probability, risk and global finance.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Andrew Durbin, <em>Frieze</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;DeWitt knows fourteen languages and is conversant in advanced math and computer code... she has harnessed her coder's brain to negative capability.

She approaches her weirdos and screw-ups with keen-eyed honesty but also with sincere affection. And the first story, &#x201c;Brutto,&#x201d; has one of the most satisfying closing lines ever. This collection has many delights, but it&#x2019;s worth picking up just for that.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus (starred review)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;DeWitt is the sort of artist that doesn&#x2019;t back away from her vision, and she takes the reader with her.

The book grew out of a public television series called <i>The Victory Garden</i>, which was essentially a how-to program aimed at home gardeners, with a recipe segment thrown in. As the show's popularity grew, so did viewer demand for more recipes; eventually, <i>Victory Garden</i> cook Marian Morash decided that a cookbook was in order, resulting in <i>The Victory Garden Cookbook</i>. The book is a wonderful hybrid encyclopedia of information for both gardeners who cook and cooks who like to garden; Morash's first goal was to so entice readers with the pleasures of eating home-grown vegetables that they, too, would take up gardening--or at least shop for the freshest ingredients instead of settling for canned or frozen goods. The book, first published in 1982, has been a huge success ever since. <p> Organized alphabetically, <i>The Victory Garden Cookbook</i> includes all the vegetables Morash grows in her own garden; in addition to information about planting, growing, and harvesting the fruits of your labor, Morash gives advice about storing vegetables, converts yields into measurements (i.e., a half-pound of small Brussels sprouts equals 28-30 sprouts, while a half-pound of medium sprouts equals 12-14) and offers tips to gardenless cooks for finding the best produce. Whether you're an avid gardener, a gardener wannabe, or simply a person who loves a good vegetable dish, <i>The Victory Garden Cookbook</i> is guaranteed to become one of your best-loved and most-used cookbooks.</p>An incomparable variety of more than 800 enticing recipes, basic gardening information, shopping tips for nongardeners, preserving and serving hints.

As well as setting forth the basic rules that must be put into practice when performing kata or applying techniques in kumite, this volume pinpoints the underlying physical and physiological principles of karate: source and concentration of power; stance, form, stability and technique; movement in all directions; basic and comprehensive aspects of training.</p><p><br>MASATOSHI NAKAYAMA carries on the tradition of his teacher, Gichin Funakoshl, the Father of Modern Karate.

Reading these stories entails abandoning the terms of one&#39;s own comfort. The author&#39;s relentless vision demands that readers allows themselves to be hypnotised, taken over by her repetitive cadences and burning images of grief and loss. And yet, in the beauty of her images there is a tremendous affirmation of the world.</p><p>From Karen Achberger s Introduction:<br><br> The seven stories of The Thirtieth Year are not narratives in the conventional sense. They are rather moments of reflection, lyrical impressions, monologues, and tightly composed images to suggest a radical rebellion against that worst of all possible worlds in which the protagonists find themselves. After a prelude ... in which a childhood of fearful obedience is recalled with quiet, dispassionate aversion, the six following stories break open to life s moments of crisis, of coming-of-age (for which the year thirty is symbolic) in the face of truth or the realization ... that there is no truth. In all the stories there is a yearning for renewal, for another order, for salvation, which at times takes on mythic proportions, and which, though glimpsed for a moment, is clearly unattainable.Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>Modern Catholic Dictionary</h2><p>The Modern Catholic Dictionary is without equal, a handy, definitive reference manual for parents, teachers, students 151 for everyone.

And it demonstrates that God has always been the Lord of the cross--a Savior who hides his grace in unattractive, inglorious places.<br><br><i>Your God Is Too Glorious </i>reminds readers that while a quiet life may look unimpressive to the world, it's the regular, everyday people that God tends to use to do his most important work.</p><p><b>Most of us lead radically ordinary lives--and they're the kind of lives God gets excited about. <br></b><br>While the world chases beauty and power and wealth, God hides his glory in the simple, the mundane, and the foolish.

Inside the lunch pail is an official certificate from her working unit. &#x201c;Hereby we confirm Comrade Lin Mei is honorably retired from Beijing Red Star Garment Factory,&#x201d; says the certificate in bright golden characters.<br><br> It does not say that Red Star Garment Factory has gone bankrupt or that, being honorably retired, Granny Lin will not receive her pension. Of course it will not provide such information, for these facts are simply not true. &#x201c;Bankrupt&#x201d; is the wrong word for a state-owned industry. &#x201c;Internal reorganization&#x201d; is what has been kindly omitted in the certificate. And, mind this, Granny Lin&#x2019;s pension is being withheld only temporarily. For how long, the factory has no further information to offer.<br><br> &#x201c;There is always a road when you get into the mountain,&#x201d; Auntie Wang, Granny Lin&#x2019;s neighbor, says to her upon being informed of Granny Lin&#x2019;s situation.<br><br> &#x201c;And there is a Toyota wherever there is a road.&#x201d; The second line of Toyota&#x2019;s commercial slips out before Granny realizes it.<br><br> &#x201c;There you go, Granny Lin. I know you are an optimistic person. Stay positive and you will find your Toyota.&#x201d;<br><br> But where on earth can she find a way to replenish her dwindling savings? For a few days Granny Lin adds, subtracts, and divides, and she decides that her savings will run out in a year&#x2014;in two years if she can skip a meal here and there, go to bed right after sunset, and stay bundled up so that she does not have to feed the insatiable stove extra coal balls through the long winter of northern China.<br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201d; Auntie Wang says the next time they meet each other at the market, looking down at the single radish Granny Lin has bought for her dinner, as plump as a Buddha, dwelling between her two palms. &#x201c;You can always find someone and get married.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Get married?&#x201d; Granny Lin says, and blushes.<br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be so conservative, Granny Lin,&#x201d; Auntie Wang says. &#x201c;How old are you?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Fifty-one.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You are even younger than I am! I am fifty-eight, but I am not as old-fashioned as you. You know what? Young people no longer have a monopoly on marriage.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t make me a clown,&#x201d; Granny Lin says.<br><br> &#x201c;I am serious, Granny Lin. There are so many old widowers in the city. I am sure there are rich and sick ones who need someone to take care of them.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You mean, I can find a caretaker&#x2019;s position for old people?&#x201d; Granny Lin asks.<br><br> Auntie Wang sighs and pokes Granny Lin&#x2019;s forehead with a finger. &#x201c;Use your brain. Not a caretaker but a wife. That way, you can at least inherit some cash when your husband dies.&#x201d;<br><br> Granny Lin gasps. She has never had a husband in her life, and the prospect of a dead husband frightens her. Yet Auntie Wang makes the decision for her right there and then, between two fish stands, and in a short time she finds Granny Lin a match.<br><br> &#x201c;Seventy-six. High blood pressure and diabetes. Wife just died. Living alone in a three-bedroom flat. Pension two thousand yuan a month. Both sons married and earning good money in the government,&#x201d; Auntie Wang says, surprised that Granny Lin remains unimpressed. &#x201c;Come on, Granny Lin, where else can you find such a good husband? The old man will die in no time, and the sons are so rich they won&#x2019;t mind sparing some of the old man&#x2019;s savings for you. Let me tell you, this is the most eligible family, as far as I know. Their doorsill has been worn away by the feet of the matchmakers. But of all the possible wives, they are interested only in you. Why? Because you are never married and you have no children. By the way, Granny Lin, how come you aren&#x2019;t married? You never told us the reason.&#x201d;<br><br> Granny Lin opens and then closes her mouth. &#x201c;It just happens,&#x201d; she says.<br><br> &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to tell me if you don&#x2019;t want to. Anyway, they don&#x2019;t want someone who has a litter of children and grandchildren. I wouldn&#x2019;t trust such a stepmother, either. Who can guarantee that she won&#x2019;t steal from the old man for her children? But you are the best. I have told them that, were there one honest person left on earth, it would be you, Granny Lin. What are you hesitating for?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t they hire someone to take care of him?&#x201d; Granny Lin asks, thinking of the two sons who might soon become her stepchildren. &#x201c;Won&#x2019;t it be cheaper in the long run?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Do you not know what those young girls from the nanny market are like? They are lazy, and they steal money&#x2014;husbands, too, if they are hired by young couples. They leave the old people sitting in their own shit all day long. To hire such a girl? Ugh. It would only push him to death quicker.&#x201d;<br><br> Granny Lin has to agree that, indeed, an older woman as a wife is a wise choice. Accompanied by Auntie Wang, Granny Lin goes to the interview with the two sons and their wives. An hour of questioning later, the two sons exchange a look, and ask if Granny Lin needs some time to consider the marriage offer. Not having much to think about, she moves into her new home in a week. Her husband, Old Tang, is sicker than she has thought. &#x201c;Alzheimer&#x2019;s,&#x201d; a daughter-in-law tells her at their wedding dinner.<br><br> Granny Lin nods, not knowing what the disease is but guessing that it has something to do with the brain. She supports her husband with both hands and leads him to the table, sitting him down and wiping away the drool from his chin.<br><br> granny lin becomes a wife, a mother, and a grandmother. She no longer remembers in what year of her life people started to call her Granny Lin instead of Auntie Lin; unmarried women, people believe, age faster. It does not matter anymore, because she feels quite qualified for her name.<br><br> Every week, one of the sons stops by and checks on Old Tang, leaving enough money for the next week. Old Tang is a quiet man, sitting in his chair by the window, immersed in his bottomless silence. Once in a while, he asks Granny Lin about his wife, and, as instructed by the two sons, Granny Lin replies that the wife is improving in the hospital and will be home in no time. But before she replies Old Tang seems to have forgotten his question, and goes back to his meditation without any sign of having heard Granny Lin. She waits for more questions that never come, and eventually gives up. She turns up the volume of the television and shuffles around the house, sweeping and dusting and wiping and washing, but the time arrives earlier each day when she finishes the housework. Then she sits down on the couch and watches the daytime soap operas. <br><br>Unlike the twelve-inch television Granny Lin used to own, which required her to make a trip across the room every time she needed to change channels (and all together she got six channels through the antenna made of two steel chopsticks), Old Tang&#x2019;s set is a monster with scores of channels, which all obey a small remote control. Dazed by all the choices she has, and by the ease of moving from one selection to another, Granny Lin soon finds that the machine does her no good. No matter what program she is watching, there is always the nagging worry that she is missing a more interesting one. Several days into her new life, Granny Lin is stunned to discover that she is no longer addicted to television, as she has been in the past ten years. Does marriage have such revolutionary power that a long-established habit can be overthrown in such a short time?<br><br> Granny Lin sighs and clicks off the television. Old Tang does not notice the silence flooding the room. She realizes then that the television is not to blame. It is because of Old Tang&#x2019;s presence that she cannot focus. She picks up an old magazine and peeks at Old Tang from behind the pages. Ten minutes grows into twenty minutes, and she continues looking at him as he insists on not meeting her gaze. She has an odd suspicion that Old Tang is not ill. He knows she is there, and he is observing her secretly. He knows that his wife of fifty-four years has left him for good and that Granny Lin is his new wife, but he refuses to acknowledge her. He pretends to have lost his mind and expects her to play along as if she were a hired caretaker. But Granny Lin decides not to concede. He is her husband; she is his wife. <br><br>Their marriage certificate is secure under her pillow. If Old Tang is testing her patience, she is ready to prove it to him; it is a tug-of-war that Granny Lin is determined to win. She puts down the magazine and looks boldly into Old Tang&#x2019;s face, trying to outstare Old Tang. Minutes stretch into an hour, and all of a sudden Granny Lin awakens in a dread that she, too, is losing her mind. She drags her body out of the couch and stretches, feeling the small cracking of her arthritic joints. She looks down at Old Tang, and he is still a statue. Indeed, he is a sick man, she thinks, and feels the shame of having cast rootless doubt on Old Tang, a man as defenseless as a newborn baby. She walks to the kitchen quickly and comes back with a glass of milk. &#x201c;Milk time,&#x201d; she says, patting Old Tang&#x2019;s cheek until he starts to swallow.<br><br> Three times a day, Granny Lin gives Old Tang an insulin shot. Only then does she catch a glimpse of the life left in Old Tang, the small flinch of the muscle when she pushes the needle into his arm.

For the first time in a single volume, <i>The History of Islam in Africa</i> presents a detailed historic mapping of the cultural, political, geographic, and religious past of this significant presence on a continent-wide scale. Bringing together two dozen leading scholars, this comprehensive work treats the historical development of the religion in each major region and examines its effects.</p><p>Without assuming prior knowledge of the subject on the part of its readers, <i>The History of Islam in Africa</i> is broken down into discrete areas, each devoted to a particular place or theme and each written by experts in that particular arena. The introductory chapters examine the principal &#x201c;gateways&#x201d; from abroad through which Islam traditionally has influenced Africans. The following two parts present overviews of Islamic history in West Africa and the Sudanic zone, and in subequatorial Africa. In the final section, the authors discuss important themes that have had an impact on Muslim communities in Africa.</p><p>Designed as both a reference and a text, <i>The History of Islam in Africa</i> will be an essential tool for libraries, scholars, and students of this growing field.</p><p><b>Contributors:</b> Edward A.

In 1943, he left school aged fourteen and joined Oldham Repertory Company where he earned fifteen bob for a seventy-hour week. After being called up for National Service in 1946 he became a paratrooper and spent several months in Palestine being shot at. On returning home, and to the theatre, Bernard was eventually approached by George Martin, then an A&amp;R man for Parlophone Records, who suggested he made a record. Just months away from producing The Beatles, Martin asked Bernard to come to Abbey Road Studios in north London and, after teaching him how to sing into a microphone, they eventually recorded two hit singles - 'The Hole in the Ground' and 'Right Said Fred'. These, together with appearances in now classic films such as <i>Two Way Stretch</i> and <i>The Wrong Arm of the Law </i>(not to mention a certain television programme called <i>Jackanory</i>), catapulted Bernard to stardom and, by the time he started filming <i>The Railway Children </i>in 1970, he was already a national treasure.</p><p>Since then, Bernard's CV has been an A-Z of the best entertainment that Britain has to offer, and, thanks to programmes such as the aforementioned <i>Jackanory,</i> <i>The Wombles</i>, and, more recently, <i>Old Jack's Boat,</i> he has become the voice of many millions of childhoods. </p><p>Seventy-five years in the making and packed with entertaining anecdotes, <i>Bernard Who?</i> tells the wonderful story of one of the longest and most celebrated careers in show business.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Church Mice adrift</h2><p>The church cat and the church mice use brains instead of brawn to rout a scurvy gang of displaced rats who have taken over the church.</p><p></p><h2>Chi Kung: The Way Of Healing</h2><p>Explains how to use the exercises to manipulate the flow of chi, or internal energies, to increase energy, release tension, relieve headaches, and improve posture</p><p></p><h2>Legend: The Genesis of Civilisation</h2><p>A sequel to A Test of Time, this text continues the author&#39;s pursuit for historical truth, and reveals what really happened in seven famous myths and legends, showing us that the passage of time has not wiped away all the evidence of the reality behind the legends.</p><p>Egyptologist and archaeologist David Rohl sets out to discover the historical truth which lies at the very heart of the Book of Genesis, but what <i>Legend: The Genesis of Civilisation</i> ends up being is a new Rohl-legend about the beginning of ancient Near Eastern civilisation--with many gaps. <p> The book is divided into three parts. Firstly, Rohl proposes that Eden and its garden was between Lakes Van and Urmin and the Caspian Sea, with Nod on its east. Then he claims the ancestors of the Sumerians migrated in the 6th millennium BC from this "Eden" to Mesopotamia, establishing Sumerian culture there, and identical with biblical Shem. The Mesopotamian and biblical Flood, he sets in the late 4th millennium BC. In part three, Rohl brings Sumerian traders to East Africa (Punt &amp; Sudan--"Kush"), and Egypt, becoming founders of Pharaonic Egypt, using cultural links c.3000BC. </p><p> Rohl needlessly burdens the book with the "new chronology" from his <i>Test of Time</i> of 1995, which is known to be 100 per cent wrong (along with the biblical "identifications") from a mass of contrary factual evidence. Rohl's story is also weakened by unsustainable guesswork on supposed language-links, artificial identifications of early biblical and Mesopotamian characters, etc. It's a lively "read", but much of it is likely to prove fictional, not historical. --<i>Kenneth Kitchen</i></p></p><h2>The Redbreast</h2><p><p>&#x201c;An elegant and complex thriller....Harrowingly beautiful.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<em>New York Times Book Review</em></p><p>&#x201c;A hugely impressive achievement&#x2014;ambitious in scope, and skilled in execution.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<em>Los Angeles Times</em></p><p>&#x201c;<em>The Redbreast</em> certainly ranks with the best of current American crime fiction.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<em>Washington Post</em></p><p>No disrespect meant to Henning Mankell and Stieg Larsson, but Jo Nesb�, the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>The Snowman</em>, is the most exciting Scandinavian thriller writer in the crime fiction business. <em>The Redbreast </em>is a fabulous&nbsp;installment in&nbsp;Nesb�&#x2019;s tough-as-nails series protagonist, Oslo police detective Harry Hole.

The Boy Who Would Live Forever has a sense of wonder and excitement that will satisfy those who loved Gateway and will delight new readers as well. <br>In <i>Gateway</i>, long after the alien Heechee abandoned their space-station, Gateway (as humans dubbed it) allowed humans to explore new worlds. The Heechee, alarmed by the alien Kugel whose goal was to destroy all organic lifeforms, had already retreated to the galactic core where they now lived in peace. Now, in <i>The Boy Who Would Live Forever</i>, humans with dreams of life among the stars are joining the Heechee at the core, to live there along with those humans and Heechee whose physical bodies have died and their minds stored in electronic memory so that their wisdom passes down through the ages.<br><br>Their peace is threatened by the Kugel, who may yet attack the core.

He lives in Palatine, Illinois.<br>BOY WHO WOULD LIVE FOREVER<br>1From Istanbul to the StarsIOn Stan's seventeenth birthday the Wrath of God came again, as it had been doing every six weeks or so. At the time Stan was alone in the apartment, cutting up vegetables for his birthday dinner. When he felt that familiar, sudden, overwhelming, disorienting, <i>horny</i> rush of vertigo he knew that it was what everybody he knew called "the Wrath of God" and nobody understood at all. Screams and sirens from outside the building told him that everybody else in that part of Istanbul was feeling it, too. Stan managed to drop the paring knife to the floor so he wouldn't cut himself. Then he staggered to a kitchen chair to wait it out.People said the Wrath was a terrible thing. Well, that was true enough. Whatever the Wrath of God really was, it struck everyone in the world at once--and not just the people still living on Earth, either. Ships in space, the colonies on Mars and Venus, as long as human beings were still within the confines of the Solar System, they all were caught up in its madness at the same moment, and the Wrath's costs in accidents and disasters were enormous. Personally, Stan didn't mind it all that much. What it felt like to him was like suddenly being overwhelmedby a vast, lonely, erotic nightmare. Like, Stan thought, probably what it would be like to get good and drunk. The erotic part was not very different from some of the yearnings Stan himself felt often enough.It didn't last very long. When it passed, Stan shook himself, picked up the things he had knocked to the floor and turned on the local TV news to see how it had gone this time.It had gone badly enough. Fires, car smashes--Istanbul's aggressive drivers relied on their split-second reflexes to avert disaster, and when the Wrath took away their skill the crashes came fast. The single worst thing that happened this time was an oil tanker that had been coming into the Golden Horn. With everyone on both the tanker's tugs and its own bridge suddenly incapacitated, the vessel had plowed, dead slow and irresistible, into one of the cruise-ship docks on the Old City side, and there it had exploded into flame.That was a really bad accident. Like any teenager, however, Stan had a high tolerance for other people's misfortunes. He yawned and got back to his chores, hoping only that the commotion wouldn't make his father too late in getting back home with the saffron and mussels for the birthday stew. When Stan finished with the vegetables he put them in a pot of cold water, and put a couple of his precious old disks on to play. This time it was Dizzy Gillespie, Jack Teagarden and the Firehouse Five Plus Three. Then he sat down to wait as he listened, thumbing through some of his comics and wondering if, this time, his father would have stayed sober long enough to get him some kind of a present for his birthday.That was the moment at which the polis came to the door.There were two of them, male and female, and they looked around the shabby apartment suspiciously. "Is this where the American citizen Walter Avery lived?" the woman demanded, and the past tense of the verb told Stan the whole story.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It didn't take the polis long to tell Stan just how it was that the Wrath had made a statistic of his father. Walter Avery had fallen down while crossing the street and a spellbound taksidriver ran right over him. There was no hope of holding the driver responsible, the woman said at once; the Wrath, you know. Anyway, the driver had long since disappeared. And, besides, witnesses said that Stan's father had been drunk at the time. Of course.The male polis took pity on Stan's wretched stare. "At least he didn't suffer," he said gruffly. "He died right away. There was no pain."The woman was impatient. "Yes, I suppose that is possible," she said, and then: "So you've been notified. You have to come to the morgue to collect the body before midnight, otherwise there'll be a charge for holding it an extra day. Good-bye."And they left.IISince there would be neither mussels nor saffron for his birthday meal, Stan found a few scraps of leftover ham and tossed them into the pot with the vegetables. While they were simmering he sat down with his head in his hands, to think about what it meant to be an American--well, half American--orphan, alone in the city of Istanbul.Two facts presented themselves. First, that long dreamed-of day when his father would sober up, take him back to America and there make a new life for the two of them--that day, always unlikely, was now definitely never going to come. From that fact it followed that, second, there was never going to be the money to pay for his college, much less to indulge his dream of flying to the Gateway asteroid and its wondrous adventure. He wasn't ever going to become one of those colorful and heroic Gateway prospectors who flew to strange parts of the Galaxy. He wasn't going to discover a hoard of priceless artifacts left by the vanished old race of Heechee. And he wasn't going to become both famous and rich.Neither of these new facts was a total surprise to Stan. His faith in either had been steadily eroding since skepticism and the first dawn of puberty arrived simultaneously, when he wasthirteen. Still, they had seemed at least theoretically possible. Now, nothing seemed possible at all.That was when Stan at last allowed himself to cry.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>While Stan was drearily cleaning up the kitchen after his flavorless birthday meal, Mr. Ozden knocked on the door.Mr. Ozden was probably around seventy years old. To Stan he looked more like a hundred--a shriveled, ugly old man, hairless on the top of his head, but with his mustache still bristly black. He was the richest man Stan had ever met. He owned the ramshackle tenement where Stan lived, and the two others that flanked it, as well as the brothel that took up two floors of one of them. Mr. Ozden was a deeply religious man, so devout in his observances that he did not allow alcohol on his premises anywhere except in the brothel, and there only for the use of non-Islamic tourists. "My deepest sympathies to you on your loss, young Stanley," he boomed in his surprisingly loud voice, automatically scanning everything in sight for traces of a forbidden bottle of whiskey. (He never found any; Stan's father had been clever about that.) "It is a terrible tragedy, but we may not question the ways of God. What are your plans, may I ask?"Stan was already serving him tea, as his father always did. "I don't exactly know yet, Mr. Ozden. I guess I'll have to get a job.""Yes, that is so," Mr. Ozden agreed. He nibbled at a crumb of the macaroon Stan had put on a saucer for him, eyeing the boy. "Perhaps working at the consulate of the Americans, like your father?""Perhaps." Stan knew that wasn't going to happen, though. It had already been discussed. The Americans weren't going to hire any translator under the age of twenty-one."That would be excellent," Mr. Ozden announced. "Especially if it were to happen quickly. As you know, the rent is due tomorrow, in addition to last week's, which has not been paid, as well as the week's before. Would they pay you well at the consulate, do you think?""As God wills," Stan said, as piously as though he meant it.The old man nodded, studying Stan in a way that made the boy uneasy."Or," he said, with a smile that revealed his expensive teeth, "I could speak to my cousin for you, if you like."Stan sat up straight; Mr. Ozden's cousin was also his brothel keeper. "You mean to work for him? Doing what?""Doing what pays well," Mr. Ozden said severely. "You are young, and I believe in good health? You could have the luck to earn a considerable sum, I think."Something was churning, not pleasantly, in Stan's belly and groin. From time to time he had seen the whores in Mr. Ozden's cousin's employ as they sunned themselves on the rooftop when business was slow, often with one or two boys among them. The boys were generally even younger than himself, mostly Kurds or hill-country Anatolians, when they weren't from Algeria or Morocco. The boys didn't last long. Stan and his friend Tan had enjoyed calling insults at them from a distance. None of them had seemed very lucky.Before Stan could speak, Mr. Ozden was going on. "My cousin's clients are not only men, you know. Often women come to him, sometimes wealthy widows, tourists from Europe or the East, who are very grateful to a young man who can give them the pleasures their husbands can no longer supply. There are frequently large tips, of which my cousin allows his people to keep nearly half--in addition to providing his people with Term Medical as long as they are in his employ, as well as quite fine accommodations and meals, at reasonable rates. Quite often the women clients are not unattractive, also. Of course," he added, his voice speeding up and diminishing in volume, "naturally there would be men as well." He stood up, most of his tea and macaroon untouched. "But perhaps the consulate will make you a better offer. You should telephone them at once in any case, to let them know of your father's sad accident. It may even be that he has some uncollected salary still to his account which you can apply to the rent. I will come again in the morning."&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>When Stan called the consulate, Mr. Goodpastor wasn't in, but his elderly secretary was touched by the news. "Oh, Stanley! This terrible Wrath thing! How awful for you! Your father was a, uh, a very nice man." That part was only conditionally true, Stan knew. His father had been a sweet-natured, generous, unreliable drunk, and the only reason the consulate had given him any work at all was that he was an American who would work for the wages of a Turk. And when Stan asked diffidently if there was any chance of uncollected salary she was all tact. "I'm afraid not, Stanley. I handle all the vouchers for Mr. Goodpastor, you know. I'm sure there's nothing there. Actually," she added, sounding embarrassed, "I'm afraid it's more likely to be a little bit the other way. You see, your father had received several salary advances lately, so his account is somewhat overdrawn. But don't worry about that, dear. I'm sure no one will press a claim."The news was nothing Stan hadn't expected. All the same, it sharpened his problem. The Americans might not demand money from him, but Mr. Ozden certainly would. Already had. And would soon be doing his very best to collect. The last time someone had been evicted from one of his tenements Stan had been watching from the roof and had seen Mr. Ozden seizing every stick of their possessions to sell for the rent owed.Which made Stan look appraisingly around their tiny flat The major furnishings didn't matter, since they belonged to Mr. Ozden in the first place. Even the bed linens and the kitchenware were Ozden's. His father's skimpy wardrobe would certainly be taken. Stan's decrepit music player and his stacks of ancient American jazz recordings; his collection of space adventures, both anim� and morphed; his school books; the small amount of food on the shelves--put them all together and they would barely cover the rent. The only other things of measurable value were the musical instruments, his battered trumpet and the drums. Of course Mr. Ozden had no proper claim to the drums, since they weren't Stan's. They'd been brought there and left by his friend Tan Kusmeroglu, when Tan's parents wouldn't let them do any more music making in their house.That Stan could do something about. When he phoned Tan'shome it was Tan's mother who answered, and she began weeping as soon as she heard the news. It was a while before Mrs. Kusmeroglu could manage to tell Stan that Oltan wasn't home. He was at work, but she would get the sad message to him at once, and if there was anything they could do ... .When he got off the phone with Mrs. Kusmeroglu, Stan looked at the clock. He had plenty of time before he had to get to the morgue, so he opened up the couch he slept on--he wasn't quite ready to move into his father's bed--and lay down in case he needed to cry some more.He didn't, though. He fell asleep instantly, which was even better for him. What woke him, hours later, was Tan Kusmeroglu standing over him. Stan could hear the braying of the muezzin, calling the faithful to prayer from the little mosque around the corner, almost drowned out by Tan's excited voice as he shook Stan awake. "Come on, Stan, wake up! The old fart's at prayer now and I borrowed my boss's van. You'll never have a better time to get your stuff out!"That meant they had ten minutes at most. Stan didn't argue. It took less than that to load the drums, the trumpet, the precious music disks and player and a handful of other things into the van. They were already driving away before Stan remembered. "I have to go to the morgue," he said.Tan took his eyes from the tour bus that was weaving from side to side before them and the delivery truck that was trying to cut in from the side long enough to glance at Stan. His expression was peculiar--almost unTanly sympathetic, a little bit flushed in the way he always looked when about to propose some new escapade. "I have been thinking about that," he announced. "You don't want to go there.""But they want me to identify my father's body. I have to.""No, you don't. What's going to happen if you do? They're going to want you to pay for a funeral, and how are you going to do that? No. You stay out of sight."Stan asked simply, "Where?""With us, stupid! You can share my room. Or," he added, grinning, "you can share my sister's if you'd rather, only you would have to marry her first."IIIEverybody in the Kusmeroglu family worked. Mr. Kusmeroglu was a junior accountant in a factory that made Korean-brand cars for export. Tan delivered household appliances for a hardware store. His sixteen-year-old sister, Naslan, worked in the patisserie of one of the big hotels along the Bosphorus. Even Mrs. Kusmeroglu worked at home, assembling beads into bracelets that spelled out verses from the Koran, for the tourist trade--when she wasn't cleaning or cooking or mending the family's clothes. Even so, Stan knew without being told, they were barely making ends meet, with only the sketchiest of Basic Medical and a constant fear of the future. Going back to complete his schooling was now as hopelessly out of the question for Stan as it had been for Tan. So was sponging off the Kusmeroglus for any length of time.He had to find a way to make money.That wasn't easy. Stan couldn't get a regular job, even if there was one to be got, because under Turkish law he was now an unregistered nonperson. He wasn't the only one of that sort, of course. There were millions like him in poverty-stricken Istanbul. It wasn't likely the authorities would bother trying to track him down--unless he turned up on some official record.The good part was that the season was nearly summer. The city's normal population of 25 million, largely destitute, was being enriched each week by two or three million tourists, sometimes even more. These people, by definition, had money and nothing better to spend it on than Istanbul's sights, meals, curios and inhabitants. "You can become a guide," Mr. Kusmeroglu pronounced at dinner. "You speak both Turkish and English without flaw, Stanl...</p><h2>The Berenstain Bears&#39; Nursery Tales</h2><p>Illus. in full color.

The first time I went to one, I almost had a claustrophobic attack looking at those poor animals. I couldn't imagine any creature living that way. Sometimes I even felt a little bad for criminals, condemned to life in a cell. I'd certainly never expected to spend my life in one.<br>But lately, life seemed to be throwing me a lot of things I'd never expected, because here I was, locked away.<br>"Hey!" I yelled, gripping the steel bars that isolated me from the world. "How long am I going to be here? When's my trial? You can't keep me in this dungeon forever!"<br>Okay, it wasn't exactly a dungeon, not in the dark, rusty-chain sense. I was inside a small cell with plain walls, a plain floor, and well . . . plain everything. Spotless. Sterile. Cold. It was actually more depressing than any musty dungeon could have managed. The bars in the doorway felt cool against my skin, hard and unyielding. Fluorescent lighting made the metal gleam in a way that felt harsh and irritating to my eyes. I could see the shoulder of a man standing rigidly to the side of the cell's entrance and knew there were probably four more guardians in the hallway out of my sight. I also knew none of them were going to answer me back, but that hadn't stopped me from constantly demanding answers from them for the last two days.<br>When the usual silence came, I sighed and slumped back on the cot in the cell's corner. Like everything else in my new home, the cot was colorless and stark. Yeah. I really was starting to wish I had a real dungeon. Rats and cobwebs would have at least given me something to watch. I stared upward and immediately had the disorienting feeling I always did in here: that the ceiling and walls were closing in around me. Like I couldn't breathe. Like the sides of the cell would keep coming toward me until no space remained, pushing out all the air . . .<br>I sat up abruptly, gasping. Don't stare at the walls and ceiling, Rose, I chastised myself. Instead, I looked down at my clasped hands and tried to figure out how I'd gotten into this mess.<br>The initial answer was obvious: someone had framed me for a crime I didn't commit. And it wasn't petty crime either. It was murder. They'd had the audacity to accuse me of the highest crime a Moroi or dhampir could commit. Now, that isn't to say I haven't killed before. I have. I've also done my fair share of rule (and even law) breaking. Cold-blooded murder, however, was not in my repertoire. Especially not the murder of a queen.<br>It was true Queen Tatiana hadn't been a friend of mine. She'd been the coolly calculating ruler of the Moroi&#x2014;a race of living, magic-using vampires who didn't kill their victims for blood. Tatiana and I had had a rocky relationship for a number of reasons. One was me dating her great-nephew, Adrian. The other was my disapproval of her policies on how to fight off Strigoi&#x2014;the evil, undead vampires who stalked us all. Tatiana had tricked me a number of times, but I'd never wanted her dead. Someone apparently had, however, and they'd left a trail of evidence leading right to me, the worst of which were my fingerprints all over the silver stake that had killed Tatiana. Of course, it was my stake, so naturally it'd have my fingerprints. No one seemed to think that was relevant.<br>I sighed again and pulled out a tiny crumpled piece of paper from my pocket. My only reading material. I squeezed it in my hand, having no need to look at the words. I'd long since memorized them. The note's contents made me question what I'd known about Tatiana. It had made me question a lot of things.<br>Frustrated with my own surroundings, I slipped out of them and into someone else's: my best friend Lissa's. Lissa was a Moroi, and we shared a psychic link, one that let me go to her mind and see the world through her eyes. All Moroi wielded some type of elemental magic. Lissa's was spirit, an element tied to psychic and healing powers. It was rare among Moroi, who usually used more physical elements, and we barely understood its abilities&#x2014;which were incredible. She'd used spirit to bring me back from the dead a few years ago, and that's what had forged our bond.<br>Being in her mind freed me from my cage but offered little help for my problem. Lissa had been working hard to prove my innocence, ever since the hearing that had laid out all the evidence against me. My stake being used in the murder had only been the beginning. My opponents had been quick to remind everyone about my antagonism toward the queen and had also found a witness to testify about my whereabouts during the murder. That testimony had left me without an alibi. The Council had decided there was enough evidence to send me to a full-fledged trial&#x2014;where I would receive my verdict.<br>Lissa had been trying desperately to get people's attention and convince them I'd been framed. She was having trouble finding anyone who would listen, however, because the entire Moroi Royal Court was consumed with preparations for Tatiana's elaborate funeral. A monarch's death was a big deal. Moroi and dhampirs&#x2014;half-vampires like me&#x2014;were coming from all over the world to see the spectacle. Food, flowers, decorations, even musicians . . . The full deal. If Tatiana had gotten married, I doubted the event would have been this elaborate. With so much activity and buzz, no one cared about me now. As far as most people were concerned, I was safely stashed away and unable to kill again. Tatiana's murderer had been found. Justice was served. Case closed.<br>Before I could get a clear picture of Lissa's surroundings, a commotion at the jail jerked me back into my own head. Someone had entered the area and was speaking to the guards, asking to see me. It was my first visitor in days. My heart pounded, and I leapt up to the bars, hoping it was someone who would tell me this had all been a horrible mistake.<br>My visitor wasn't quite who I'd expected.<br>"Old man," I said wearily. "What are you doing here?"<br>Abe Mazur stood before me. As always, he was a sight to behold. It was the middle of summer&#x2014;hot and humid, seeing as we were right in the middle of rural Pennsylvania&#x2014;but that didn't stop him from wearing a full suit. It was a flashy one, perfectly tailored and adorned with a brilliant purple silk tie and matching scarf that just seemed like overkill. Gold jewelry flashed against the dusky hue of his skin, and he looked like he'd recently trimmed his short black beard. Abe was a Moroi, and although he wasn't royal, he wielded enough influence to be.<br>He also happened to be my father.<br>"I'm your lawyer," he said cheerfully. "Here to give you legal counsel, of course."<br>"You aren't a lawyer," I reminded him. "And your last bit of advice didn't work out so well." That was mean of me. Abe&#x2014;despite having no legal training whatsoever&#x2014;had defended me at my hearing. Obviously, since I was locked up and headed for trial, the outcome of that hadn't been so great. But, in all my solitude, I'd come to realize that he'd been right about something. No lawyer, no matter how good, could have saved me at the hearing. I had to give him credit for stepping up to a lost cause, though considering our sketchy relationship, I still wasn't sure why he had. My biggest theories were that he didn't trust royals and that he felt paternal obligation. In that order.<br>"My performance was perfect," he argued. "Whereas your compelling speech in which you said &#x2018;if I was the murderer' didn't do us any favors. Putting that image in the judge's head wasn't the smartest thing you could have done."<br>I ignored the barb and crossed my arms. "So what are you doing here? I know it's not just a fatherly visit. You never do anything without a reason."<br>"Of course not. Why do anything without a reason?"<br>"Don't start up with your circular logic."<br>He winked. "No need to be jealous. If you work hard and put your mind to it, you might just inherit my brilliant logic skills someday."<br>"Abe," I warned. "Get on with it."<br>"Fine, fine," he said. "I've come to tell you that your trial might be moved up."<br>"W-what? That's great news!" At least, I thought it was. His expression said otherwise. Last I'd heard, my trial might be months away. The mere thought of that&#x2014;of being in this cell so long&#x2014;made me feel claustrophobic again.<br>"Rose, you do realize that your trial will be nearly identical to your hearing. Same evidence and a guilty verdict."<br>"Yeah, but there must be something we can do before that, right? Find proof to clear me?" Suddenly, I had a good idea of what the problem was. "When you say &#x2018;moved up,' how soon are we talking?"<br>"Ideally, they'd like to do it after a new king or queen is crowned. You know, part of the post-coronation festivities."<br>His tone was flippant, but as I held his dark gaze, I caught the full meaning. Numbers rattled in my head. "The funeral's this week, and the elections are right after . . . You're saying I could go to trial and be convicted in, what, practically two weeks?"<br>Abe nodded.<br>I flew toward the bars again, my heart pounding in my chest. "Two weeks? Are you serious?"<br>When he'd said the trial had been moved up, I'd figured maybe it was a month away. Enough time to find new evidence. How would I have pulled that off? Unclear. Now, time was rushing away from me. Two weeks wasn't enough, especially with so much activity at Court. Moments ago, I'd resented the long stretch of time I might face. Now, I had too little of it, and the answer to my next question could make things worse.<br>"How long?" I asked, trying to control the trembling in my voice. "How long after the verdict until they . . . carry out the sentence?"<br>I still didn't entirely know what all I'd inherited from Abe, but we seemed to clearly share one trait: an unflinching ability to deliver bad news.<br>"Probably immediately."<br>"Immediately." I backed up, nearly sat on the bed, and then felt a new surge of adrenaline. "Immediately? So. Two weeks. In two weeks, I could be . . . dead."<br>Because that was the thing&#x2014;the thing that had been hanging over my head the moment it became clear someone had planted enough evidence to frame me. People who killed queens didn't get sent to prison. They were executed. Few crimes among Moroi and dhampirs got that kind of punishment. We tried to be civilized in our justice, showing we were better than the bloodthirsty Strigoi. But certain crimes, in the eyes of the law, deserved death. Certain people deserved it, too&#x2014;say, like, treasonous murderers. As the full impact of the future fell upon me, I felt myself shake and tears come dangerously close to spilling out of my eyes.<br>"That's not right!" I told Abe. "That's not right, and you know it!"<br>"Doesn't matter what I think," he said calmly. "I'm simply delivering the facts."<br>"Two weeks," I repeated. "What can we do in two weeks? I mean . . . you've got some lead, right? Or . . . or . . . you can find something by then? That's your specialty." I was rambling and knew I sounded hysterical and desperate. Of course, that was because I felt hysterical and desperate.<br>"It's going to be difficult to accomplish much," he explained. "The Court's preoccupied with the funeral and elections. Things are disorderly&#x2014;which is both good and bad."<br>I knew about all the preparations from watching Lissa. I'd seen the chaos already brewing. Finding any sort of evidence in this mess wouldn't just be difficult. It could very well be impossible.<br>Two weeks. Two weeks, and I could be dead.<br>"I can't," I told Abe, my voice breaking. "I'm not . . . meant to die that way."<br>"Oh?" He arched an eyebrow. "You know how you're supposed to die?"<br>"In battle." One tear managed to escape, and I hastily wiped it away. I'd always lived my life with a tough image. I didn't want that shattering, not now when it mattered most of all. "In fighting. Defending those I love. Not . . . not through some planned execution."<br>"This is a fight of sorts," he mused. "Just not a physical one. Two weeks is still two weeks. Is it bad? Yes. But it's better than one week. And nothing's impossible. Maybe new evidence will turn up. You simply have to wait and see."<br>"I hate waiting. This room . . . it's so small. I can't breathe. It'll kill me before any executioner does."<br>"I highly doubt it." Abe's expression was still cool, with no sign of sympathy. Tough love. "You've fearlessly fought groups of Strigoi, yet you can't handle a small room?"<br>"It's more than that! Now I have to wait each day in this hole, knowing there's a clock ticking down to my death and almost no way to stop it."<br>"Sometimes the greatest tests of our strength are situations that don't seem so obviously dangerous. Sometimes surviving is the hardest thing of all."<br>"Oh. No. No." I stalked away, pacing in small circles. "Do not start with all that noble crap. You sound like Dimitri when he used to give me his deep life lessons."<br>"He survived this very situation. He's surviving other things too."<br>Dimitri.<br>I took a deep breath, calming myself before I answered. Until this murder mess, Dimitri had been the biggest complication in my life. A year ago&#x2014;though it seemed like eternity&#x2014;he'd been my instructor in high school, training me to be one of the dhampir guardians who protect Moroi. He'd accomplished that&#x2014;and a lot more. We'd fallen in love, something that wasn't allowed. We'd managed it as best we could, even finally coming up with a way for us to be together. That hope had disappeared when he'd been bitten and turned Strigoi. It had been a living nightmare for me. Then, through a miracle no one had believed possible, Lissa had used spirit to transform him back to a dhampir. But things unfortunately hadn't quite returned to how they'd been before the Strigoi attack.<br>I glared at Abe. "Dimitri survived this, but he was horribly depressed about it! He still is. About everything."<br>The full weight of the atrocities he'd committed as a Strigoi haunted Dimitri. He couldn't forgive himself and swore he could never love anyone now. The fact that I had begun dating Adrian didn't help matters. After a number of futile efforts, I'd accepted that Dimitri and I were through. I'd moved on, hoping I could have something real with Adrian now.<br>"Right," Abe said dryly. "He's depressed, but you're the picture of happiness and joy."<br>I sighed. "Sometimes talking to you is like talking to myself: pretty damned annoying. Is there any other reason you're here? Other than to deliver the terrible news? I would have been happier living in ignorance."<br>I'm not supposed to die this way. I'm not supposed to see it coming. My death is not some appointment penciled in on a calendar.<br>He shrugged. "I just wanted to see you. And your arrangements."<br>Yes, he had indeed, I realized. Abe's eyes had always come back to me as we spoke; there'd been no question I held his attention. There was nothing in our banter to concern my guards. But every so often, I'd see Abe's gaze flick around, taking in the hall, my cell, and whatever other details he found interesting.

In UNDER THE BANNER OF HEAVEN, he shifts his focus from extremes of physical adventure to extremes of religious belief within our own borders. At the core of his book is an appalling double murder committed by two Mormon Fundamentalist brothers, Ron and Dan Lafferty, who insist they received a revelation from God commanding them to kill their blameless victims. Beginning with a meticulously researched account of this<b> </b>&#x201c;divinely inspired&#x201d; crime, Krakauer constructs a multilayered, bone-chilling narrative of messianic delusion,<b> </b>savage violence, polygamy, and unyielding faith. Along the way, he uncovers a shadowy offshoot of America&#x2019;s fastest-growing religion, and raises provocative questions about the nature of religious belief.<br><br>Krakauer takes readers inside isolated communities in the American West, Canada, and<b> </b>Mexico, where some forty-thousand Mormon Fundamentalists believe the mainstream Mormon Church went unforgivably astray when it renounced polygamy. Defying both civil authorities and the Mormon establishment in Salt Lake City, the leaders of these outlaw sects are zealots who answer only to God. Marrying prodigiously and with virtual impunity (the leader of the largest fundamentalist church took seventy-five &#x201c;plural wives,&#x201d; several of whom were wed to him when they were fourteen or fifteen and he was in his eighties), fundamentalist prophets exercise absolute control over the lives of their followers, and preach that any day now the world will be swept clean in a hurricane of fire, sparing only their most obedient adherents. <br><br>Weaving the story of the Lafferty brothers and their fanatical brethren with a clear-eyed look at Mormonism&#x2019;s violent past, Krakauer examines the underbelly of the most successful homegrown faith in the United States, and finds a distinctly American brand of religious extremism. The result is vintage Krakauer, an utterly compelling work of nonfiction that illuminates an otherwise confounding realm of human behavior.</p><p>In 1984, Ron and Dan Lafferty murdered the wife and infant daughter of their younger brother Allen. The crimes were noteworthy not merely for their brutality but for the brothers' claim that they were acting on direct orders from God. In <i>Under the Banner of Heaven</i>, Jon Krakauer tells the story of the killers and their crime but also explores the shadowy world of Mormon fundamentalism from which the two emerged. The Mormon Church was founded, in part, on the idea that true believers could speak directly with God. But while the mainstream church attempted to be more palatable to the general public by rejecting the controversial tenet of polygamy, fundamentalist splinter groups saw this as apostasy and took to the hills to live what they believed to be a righteous life. When their beliefs are challenged or their patriarchal, cult-like order defied, these still-active groups, according to Krakauer, are capable of fighting back with tremendous violence. While Krakauer's research into the history of the church is admirably extensive, the real power of the book comes from present-day information, notably jailhouse interviews with Dan Lafferty. Far from being the brooding maniac one might expect, Lafferty is chillingly coherent, still insisting that his motive was merely to obey God's command. Krakauer's accounts of the actual murders are graphic and disturbing, but such detail makes the brothers' claim of divine instruction all the more horrifying. In an age where Westerners have trouble comprehending what drives Islamic fundamentalists to kill, Jon Krakauer advises us to look within America's own borders. <i>--John Moe</i><b>JON KRAKAUER is the author of <i>Eiger Dreams, Into the Wild, </i>and<i> Into Thin Air</i>, and is editor of the Modern Library Exploration series. </b></p><h2>Final Cut: Dreams and Disaster in the Making of Heaven&#39;s Gate</h2><p>Combining wit, insightful anecdotes, and historical perspective, the executive producer of &#34;Heaven&#39;s Gate&#34; offers an inside look at the making of the thirty-six-million-dollar disaster and its impact on modern moviemaking</p><p>At the time of filming Heaven&#39;s Gate Steven Bach was the senior vice-president and head of worldwide production for United Artists.

In his new novel, <b>Choke</b><i>,</i> he gives readers a vision of life and love and sex and mortality that is both chillingly brilliant and teeth-rattlingly funny.<br><br>Victor Mancini, a dropout from medical school, has devised a complicated scam to pay for his mother's elder care: Pretend to be choking on a piece of food in a restaurant and the person who "saves you" will feel responsible for the rest of his life. Multiply that a couple of hundred times and you generate a healthy flow of checks, week in, week out. Between fake choking gigs, Victor works at Colonial Dunsboro with a motley group of losers and stoners trapped in 1734, cruises sex addiction groups for action ("You put twenty sexaholics around a table night after night and don't be surprised."), and visits his mother, whose anarchic streak made his childhood a mad whirl and whose Alzheimer's disease now hides what may be the startling truth about his (possibly divine?) parentage. An antihero for our deranging times, Victor's whole existence is a struggle to wrest an identity from overwhelming forces. His creator, Chuck Palahniuk, is the visionary we need and the satirist we deserve.</p><p>Victor Mancini is a ruthless con artist. Victor Mancini is a med-school dropout who's taken a job playing an Irish indentured servant in a colonial-era theme park in order to help care for his Alzheimer's-afflicted mother. Victor Mancini is a sex addict. Victor Mancini is a direct descendant of Jesus Christ. All of these statements about the protagonist of <i>Choke</i> are more or less true. Welcome, once again, to the world of Chuck Palahniuk. <p> "Art never comes from happiness." So says Mancini's mother only a few pages into the novel. Given her own dicey and melodramatic style of parenting, you would think that her son's life would be chock-full of nothing but art. Alas, that's not the case. In the fine tradition of Oedipus, Stephen Dedalus, and Anthony Soprano, Victor hasn't quite reconciled his issues with his mother. Instead, he's trawling sexual-addiction recovery meetings for dates and purposely choking in restaurants for a few moments of attention. Longing for a hug, in other words, he's settling for the Heimlich.</p><p> Thematically, this is pretty familiar Palahniuk territory. It would be a pity to disclose the surprises of the plot, but suffice it to say that what we have here is a little bit of Tom Robbins's <i>Another Roadside Attraction</i>, a little bit of Don DeLillo's <i>The Day Room</i>, and, well, a little bit of <i>Fight Club</i>. Just as with <i>Fight Club</i> and the other two novels under Palahniuk's belt, we get a smattering of gloriously unflinching sound bites, including this skeptical bit on prayer chains: "A spiritual pyramid scheme. As if you can gang up on God. Bully him around."</p><p> Whether this is the novel that will break Palahniuk into the mainstream is hard to say. For a fourth book, in fact, the ratio of iffy, "dude"-intensive dialogue to interesting and insightful passages is a little higher than we might wish. In the end, though, the author's nerve and daring pull the whole thing off--just barely. And what's next for Victor Mancini's creator? Leave the last word to him, declaring as he does in the final pages: "Maybe it's our job to invent something better.... What it's going to be, I don't know." <i>--Bob Michaels</i></p>Praise for Chuck Palahniuk:<br><br>"Palahniuk is one of the freshest, most intriguing voices to appear in a long time.

This brutal, shattering glimpse of the fate of millions of Russians under Stalin shook Russia and shocked the world when it first appeared. Discover the importance of a piece of bread or an extra bowl of soup, the incredible luxury of a book, the ingenious possibilities of a nail, a piece of string or a single match in a world where survival is all. Here safety, warmth and food are the first objectives. Reading it, you enter a world of incarceration, brutality, hard manual labour and freezing cold - and participate in the struggle of men to survive both the terrible rigours of nature and the inhumanity of the system that defines their conditions of life. Though twice-decorated for his service at the front during the Second World War, Aleksandr Isayevich Solzhenitsyn (1918-2008) was arrested in 1945 for making derogatory remarks about Stalin, and sent to a series of brutal Soviet labour camps in the Arctic Circle, where he remained for eight years. Released after Stalin&#39;s death, he worked as a teacher, publishing his novel One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich with the approval of Nikita Khrushchev in 1962, to huge success. His 1967 novel Cancer Ward, as well as his magnum opus The Gulag Archipelago, were not as well-received by Soviet authorities, and not long after being awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1970, Solzhenitsyn was deported from the USSR. In 1994, after twenty years in exile, Solzhenitsyn made his long-awaited return to Russia. If you enjoyed One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, you might also like Yevgeny Zamyatin&#39;s We, available in Penguin Classics. &#39;It is a blow struck for human freedom all over the world ... and it is gloriously readable&#39; Sunday Times</p><p>Solzhenitsyn&#39;s first book, this economical, relentless novel is one of the most forceful artistic indictments of political oppression in the Stalin-era Soviet Union. The simply told story of a typical, grueling day of the titular character&#39;s life in a labor camp in Siberia, is a modern classic of Russian literature and quickly cemented Solzhenitsyn&#39;s international reputation upon publication in 1962. It is painfully apparent that Solzhenitsyn himself spent time in the gulags--he was imprisoned for nearly a decade as punishment for making derogatory statements about Stalin in a letter to a friend.From the icy blast of reveille through the sweet release of sleep, Ivan Denisovich endures. A common carpenter, he is one of millions viciously imprisoned for countless years on baseless charges, sentenced to the waking nightmares of the Soviet work camps in Siberia. Even in the face of degrading hatred, where life is reduced to a bowl of gruel and a rare cigarette, hope and dignity prevail. This powerful novel of fact is a scathing indictment of Communist tyranny, and an eloquent affirmation of the human spirit.</p><h2>Point it: Traveller&#39;s Language Kit</h2><p>You may be fluent in many languages but sometimes you could find yourself &#39;off the beaten track&#39; where you can&#39;t communicate. &#39;Point it&#39; with 1300 photos, maps and drawings to point at, is the answer.

And of course she was supposed to win. How Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 election to Donald Trump is the riveting story of a sure thing gone off the rails. For every Comey revelation or hindsight acknowledgment about the electorate, no explanation of defeat can begin with anything other than the core problem of Hillary's campaign--the candidate herself. <br><br>Through deep access to insiders from the top to the bottom of the campaign, political writers Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes have reconstructed the key decisions and unseized opportunities, the well-intentioned misfires and the hidden thorns that turned a winnable contest into a devastating loss. Drawing on the authors' deep knowledge of Hillary from their previous book, the acclaimed biography <i>HRC</i>, <i>Shattered</i> offers an object lesson in how Hillary herself made victory an uphill battle, how her difficulty articulating a vision irreparably hobbled her impact with voters, and how the campaign failed to internalize the lessons of populist fury from the hard-fought primary against Bernie Sanders. <br><br>Moving blow-by-blow from the campaign's difficult birth through the bewildering terror of election night, <i>Shattered</i> tells an unforgettable story with urgent lessons both political and personal, filled with revelations that will change the way readers understand just what happened to America on November 8, 2016.</p><p><b>JONATHAN ALLEN</b> is a national political reporter with <i>NBC News</i>.

Her motorcade sped toward Roosevelt Island on the morning of June 13, 2015. In a little more than an hour, she would officially kick off what she hoped would be a trailblazing, glass-ceiling-shattering campaign for the presidency. For most of the previous forty-eight hours, she had been trying to give a feel of historic importance to her first major address. It just wasn&#x2019;t there yet. <br><br>She picked up the phone and called her chief speechwriter, Dan Schwerin. After two days of trading drafts with Hillary, after waiting through the delay of a power outage at her Chappaqua, New York, home, the bearded thirty-two-year-old with a signature chestnut pompadour was just about to board the tram connecting Manhattan to the East River island. He had stayed up all night, pulling together tweaks to the 3:30 a.m. version of the speech, and he looked hungover. Now, battling exhaustion and the sweltering heat, Schwerin pulled out his laptop one more time and sat down on the platform so that Hillary could dictate her final edits.<br><br>The key passage of the speech was an explanation of why she was running for president: &#x201c;to make our economy work for you and for every American.&#x201d; In the middle of that run&#x2014;about how she would do it and who she would fight for&#x2014;Hillary wanted to connect herself and her campaign to Franklin Roosevelt, the president who defined the aspirations of the Democratic Party and much of the nation for generations. <br><br>&#x201c;Here on Roosevelt Island,&#x201d; she said to Schwerin, &#x201c;I believe we have a continuing rendezvous with destiny.&#x201d;<br><br>He tapped the echo of FDR&#x2019;s 1936 Democratic convention speech into his computer at 11 a.m. and took the next cable car to the island. Few would notice the last-minute change. The cluttered speech had become a testament to the aimlessness and passive-aggressive infighting that plagued the early stages of Hillary&#x2019;s campaign. Hillary had tried to put together a team this time that would feature far less internal drama than her failed 2008 bid. Back then, big personalities had clashed openly, aired dirty laundry and strategy details in the press, and sometimes pursued their own goals at the expense of hers. In the intervening years, she&#x2019;d assigned a lot of the blame for her loss to the warring inside her campaign. But that was hardly the only ailment from 2008 that she hoped to remedy. She hadn&#x2019;t sold a vision for the country. She&#x2019;d run away from being a woman instead of leaning into the unique aspect of her political story. To manage her campaign, she&#x2019;d tapped a friend rather than the top pro. She&#x2019;d let her husband run wild on the trail. And she had failed to take advantage of the latest technology to build a movement of grassroots supporters and donors.<br><br>From a strategic standpoint, she&#x2019;d dumped millions of dollars into Iowa, the first-in-the-nation caucus, even though that only elevated the importance of her devastating third-place finish there. She&#x2019;d gone on the attack against a better-liked rival whose platform more closely mirrored the values of the party&#x2019;s base, creating a boomerang effect on her personal standing. Perhaps worst of all, she&#x2019;d obsessed over winning the popular vote in big states rather than targeting the all-important delegates and superdelegates whose votes at the Democratic convention determined the party&#x2019;s nominee.<br><br>But the idea burned into her mind as much as anything else was that she had lost because she&#x2019;d hired people who put their own interests above getting her elected. The absence of palace intrigue on her opponent&#x2019;s side&#x2014;the &#x201c;no drama Obama&#x201d; campaign&#x2014;was the kind of purpose-driven loyalty she pined for.<br><br>Over the next seven years, Hillary would rebuild her political organization while working at the State Department and the Clinton Foundation, punish those who had been disloyal to her, and prepare herself to mount a second bid for the most powerful job on the planet. When she conceded to Obama in 2008, she&#x2019;d thanked voters for putting &#x201c;18 million cracks&#x201d; in the glass ceiling of the presidency. By the time she finished the 2016 campaign, she believed, that glass ceiling would lay shattered beneath her feet. And yet what Hillary couldn&#x2019;t quite see is that no matter how she recast the supporting roles in this production, or emphasized different parts of the script, the main character hadn&#x2019;t changed.<br><br>Huddled around a white table in the conference room of the Clintons&#x2019; midtown Manhattan personal office in the early spring of 2015, months before she would go to Roosevelt Island to deliver her first major address, the first hires of Hillary&#x2019;s worst-kept-secret campaign outlined a plan to fly her to Iowa. They had pegged the Hawkeye State, where caucus-goers had doomed her first bid for the Oval Office, as the best spot for her kickoff speech. But Hillary didn&#x2019;t like what she was hearing. She didn&#x2019;t want to go big, at least not yet. And she didn&#x2019;t want the first major address of what could be a history-making campaign to be set against a minimalistic backdrop like some farmer&#x2019;s back porch. <br><br>To the chagrin of campaign manager Robby Mook, who would have to build a billion-dollar apparatus, Hillary had been dragging her feet about making things official. She understood that her team needed to start raising funds, hire more staff, and begin recruiting volunteers. But she also knew she had to be fully prepared for this battle. And she just wasn&#x2019;t ready.<br><br>Mook, clean-cut with close-cropped brown hair and lively hazel eyes, was antsy. At one point, there was even discussion of his starring in a campaign-launching video announcing the formation of an &#x201c;exploratory&#x201d; committee. But Hillary was wary of repeating some of the major mistakes of her 2008 bid. She had rushed into her announcement that year to compete with Obama, and she had made it all about her: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m in it to win,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said in her campaign-opening video. This time, she wanted to show she was listening to voters&#x2014;talking with them one-on-one or in small groups and in informal settings (all with the knowledge that everything she did would be dutifully reported by a press corps hungry for nuggets from the trail).<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve come so far under President Obama, but we have so many problems,&#x201d; she told her advisers. &#x201c;I want to make sure I&#x2019;m the right person.&#x201d; Given that everyone in the room had ostensibly been hired to run her campaign, and that some of them had been in on earlier discussions about the timing and logistics of her launch, no one believed she was really so ambivalent. But, sitting by a bank of three windows, twenty-seven floors above the bustle of Seventh Avenue, Hillary rendered a clear verdict on the Iowa kickoff plan: &#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>She would go to Iowa in April, she said, but not to deliver a launch speech&#x2014;and not in a private jet. She would drive, in a van, and try to find people along the way who weren&#x2019;t expecting to run into her. After a quarter of a century locked inside the political bubble of the New York&#x2013;to&#x2013;Washington stretch of the Acela corridor, Hillary was eager to find out what people thought about the state of the country&#x2014;and about her. She didn&#x2019;t want to officially kick off the campaign until she&#x2019;d had a chance to repeat what she&#x2019;d done when she first ran for a New York Senate seat: gather information from voters. &#x201c;She wanted to do that before giving a big speech and having a big event and saying &#x2018;I have all this figured out,&#x2019; &#x201d; said one aide. &#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t have it all figured out.&#x201d; Her big opening address would come at a location with more historic consequence, but for now, a &#x201c;soft&#x201d; launch could go forward&#x2014;an upbeat video followed by the road trip.<br><br>The time would come for her to speak into the winds of history, but, as much as she knew Iowa wasn&#x2019;t the place, she also knew that her moment hadn&#x2019;t yet come. She&#x2019;d been off the political battlefield for seven years. As secretary of state, she&#x2019;d worked to win concessions in diplomatic back rooms across the world, but she didn&#x2019;t have to worry about securing millions of votes. Barack Obama had been elected president and the Tea Party had risen in the time since she&#x2019;d last been on the campaign trail as a candidate. The nation&#x2019;s political bearings had shifted. And, if her 2014 book tour had taught her anything, it was that she was rusty as hell. Talking to voters, she hoped, would help her sharpen her political skills and develop her vision for the country&#x2019;s future.<br><br>Obama had been relentlessly superb at telling voters why he was running for president and giving them a window into how he would govern. He was confident, cocky even, about his vision. Hillary, a modest, midwestern Methodist with a love of minutiae, was unshakably focused on the trees rather than the forest. This campaign would test the A student&#x2019;s ability to adapt&#x2014;to subordinate her nature to her need to win.<br><br>In preparing to campaign again, she studied Obama&#x2019;s February 2007 launch speech in Springfield, the one he delivered on the steps of the Old State Capitol&#x2014;the one that connected him with fellow Illinois state legislator Abraham Lincoln, who had freed the slaves in an act that set the first stone on Obama&#x2019;s improbable path to the presidency. &#x201c;She kept harkening back to Obama in Springfield,&#x201d; said one of Hillary&#x2019;s top advisers. &#x201c;She had gone back to read that speech and how important it was for people as a marker of what he would do in the presidency. She viewed it as an important kind of road map for her governing principles and her actual plans to be president.&#x201d;<br><br>In her mind, the first landmark address of what she hoped and believed would be a historic campaign couldn&#x2019;t be about the politics of the moment, about tipping a few Iowa caucus-goers in her direction. It had to be about how she could reshape the nation from the Oval Office. For Hillary, a wonk in the best and worst senses of the word, that meant devising her policy agenda before she ever stepped to the podium. Most politicians understand that voters are looking for big, bold principles&#x2014;easy-to-grasp concepts&#x2014;and that the details can be filled in to fit them. For Hillary, policy is vision, and she would try to build a platform, program by program, into a blueprint for the country.<br><br>This prospect was actually a relief. It was more comfortable for her to sit in four-hour meetings at the conference table with her policy chief&#x2014;the reedy, whip-smart Jake Sullivan&#x2014;than to define herself by a small set of guiding principles and shape her policy ideas to fit them.<br><br>Hillary adored the thirty-eight-year-old Sullivan, enough to joke publicly about her confidence that he would someday be president of the United States. He had served Hillary as deputy chief of staff at State, a position from which he gradually vacuumed up all or parts of the jobs of several senior colleagues. Hillary appreciated both his competence and his ambition. His instincts on policy and politics matched hers. So she turned to him to run what she thought was the most important part of the campaign: the substance. That&#x2019;s what bonded Hillary to her young prot�g�&#x2014;they geeked out over policy&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s what she wanted at the heart of her first address to the voting public.<br><br>&#x201c;This is her deeply held thing: elections should be about policy,&#x201d; said one senior Hillary adviser. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a textbook quality to her articulation of things.&#x201d; That would make every step of narrative building its own form of excruciating drudgery. But it would soon seem like a minor nuisance for a campaign that was miserable even before it started.<br><br>In early March, just as she was planning to reintroduce herself to a nation that felt it knew her all too well with a video announcement of her campaign, the New York Times reported that Hillary had used an e-mail address tied to a personal server at her family home in Chappaqua, to conduct official State Department business. The e-mail story would bedevil her straight through Election Day, robbing her of the ability to create a positive narrative for her candidacy and, as one top adviser put it, returning to her like a cold sore. &#x201c;You never know when it&#x2019;s going to pop up,&#x201d; this adviser said. &#x201c;You think you&#x2019;re over it and then [it pops]up again.&#x201d;<br><br>At the time, it was impossible to know how long the e-mail story would last and just how badly it would damage the campaign.<br><br>&#x201c;Did you have any idea of the depth of this story?&#x201d; campaign chairman John Podesta asked Mook when it broke.<br><br>&#x201c;Nope,&#x201d; Mook replied. &#x201c;We brought up the existence of emails in research this summer but were told that everything was taken care of.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s reassuring,&#x201d; Podesta shot back. &#x201c;Yikes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Mook responded. &#x201c;This is going to be an interesting campaign. I&#x2019;m in this zen place now where I&#x2019;m focusing on the website and telling myself this is all background noise!&#x201d;<br><br>For those who couldn&#x2019;t bury their heads, praying for divine intervention was an attractive alternative. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m lighting candles in church all the time,&#x201d; pollster John Anzalone told Mook.<br><br>When the e-mail story first hit, Hillary&#x2019;s aides were still trying to get a feel for one another. The crisis acted as a catalyst for infighting. Publicly, she was running a no-drama campaign. But behind the scenes, Hillary&#x2019;s brain trust broke into tribes:<br><br>�The Mook Mafia, led by Mook; Marlon Marshall, his top lieutenant; Elan Kriegel, the data analytics chief; and Oren Shur, the paid media director<br><br>�The State Crew, led on the inside by Huma Abedin, the vice chairwoman; Jake Sullivan; Nick Merrill, the traveling press secretary; and Dan Schwerin, the chief speechwriter; with longtime Clinton advisers Cheryl Mills and Philippe Reines invisibly guiding Hillary behind the scenes<br><br>�The Consultants, led by Joel Benenson, the chief strategist; Jim Margolis, the ad-maker; and Mandy Grunwald, the longtime Clinton message maven<br><br>�The Communications Shop, led by Jennifer Palmieri, the communications director; Kristina Schake, her deputy; and Christina Reynolds, the research director, who had worked with Palmieri on the John Edwards campaign<br><br>At the start, Podesta was seen as a high-level troubleshooter. Short, wiry, and in his midsixties, the marathon-running former top aide to Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama had deep ties to every power center in the Democratic Party. He was supposed to play an adult-in-the-room role on the campaign, coordinating with Bill&#x2019;s office, the White House, Democratic interest groups, and major donors. In theory, Podesta would provide air cover in Clintonworld, lessening the burden on Mook and allowing the campaign manager to focus on executing.</p><h2>The Biographical Encyclopedia of the Negro Baseball Leagues</h2><p>Covering the years between 1872 and 1950, the first comprehensive look at the history of professional baseball&#39;s Negro Leagues documents the careers of four thousand players, including Jackie Robinson, Willie Mays, and Satchel Paige.</p><p>This is a landmark publication in the fields of baseball history and African American history. It documents more than 4,000 players on Negro League teams from 1872 through 1950. According to the publisher, this is the first book to comprehensively cover the careers of all African Americans who played with a team of major-league quality or whose careers had some historical significance. It includes all major-league Hall of Fame players who also played in the Negro League.<p>The author traversed the country, interviewing men who played in the Negro Leagues about their baseball exploits and the careers of their now-deceased teammates. Information was also gathered by analyzing archival resources for contemporary accounts of games and by viewing microfilm reels of black newspapers. Entries include player name and nicknames, media names, etc.; vital statistics, such as height and weight, birth and death dates; and career information, including years of active play, positions played, teams of which the player was a member. Standard baseball statistical data, such as batting averages and pitching records, are given in the body of the text. The length of entries ranges from 20-word footnotelike entries to a 2,000-word essay on the great pitcher Satchel Paige.</p><p>Entries include delightful anecdotal material as well. For instance, the entry for pitcher Luis Tiant (father of the 1970s Red Sox pitcher of the same name) notes his wily moves and deceptive screwball with which he held Babe Ruth to a single in a double-header. Other entries chronicle the careers of players generally unknown to the public, many of whom were some of the best men to ever play the game. Such is the case of perhaps the most versatile player, Martin Dihigo, who played virtually every position of the infield (including pitcher) and outfield for 22 years (1923-45) in the Negro League and in Latin America. One year in Mexico he led the league in hitting with a .387 batting average and also in pitching with a 18-2 record and .097 ERA.</p><p>Not all entries are biographical: there are many entries on Negro League teams. An appendix provides a bibliography of books, periodicals, newspapers, and special collections and a list of players interviewed. Three inserts of photographs of players are included.</p><p><i>The Biographical Encyclopedia of the Negro Baseball Leagues</i> is a one-of-a-kind work that all public libraries should acquire. <i></i></p>Editor Riley is an accomplished writer and a recognized authority on the Negro leagues, having published numerous books on the subject (e.g., Too Dark for the Hall , T.K. Pubs., 1991). His comprehensive reference book documents the careers of 4000 players on teams of major league caliber between 1872 and 1950. Notable Hall of Famers included are Hank Aaron, Satchel Paige, Ernie Banks, and Jackie Robinson. Arranged alphabetically, the citations contain a variety of biographical and statistical information. This valuable compilation also provides illustrations, team histories, an appendix on players, plus an exhaustive bibliography detailing books, periodicals, booklets, and newpaper articles.

The survivors are blessed-or cursed-with a variety of supernatural powers, from great physical strength to Ruby's ability to invade and control the minds of others. These talents make the children valuable to the corrupt government. However, the adults controlling the League turn out to be corrupt themselves. When Ruby realizes that the latest mission she has been sent on was designed to eliminate some members of her team, she decides to circumvent the League. The teen sets out with one of her friends, Jude, in search of a flash drive that holds information that may offer a cure for the disease that killed so many children. They are soon joined by other members of the League. Struggling to survive winter in a lawless country with minimal supplies is difficult enough. Trying to keep everyone focused on the same goal when the team members aren't sure if they can trust one another is harder. When they finally find the boy with the flash drive, he is so ill that it's not clear if he will survive-or help them if he does.

Their songs are stout as a pilgrim's stave or a pair of good shoes, and were meant to be taken on the great journey."--Andrew Schelling, from his Introduction</p><p>Gary Snyder brought the Chinese Zen poet Han-Shan (<i>Cold Mountain</i>) to prominence through translations that struck a cord with Zen enthusiasts and back-to-nature mystics alike. Now Red Pine, Mike O'Connor, and four other translators have breathed life into the literary descendants of Han-Shan, poet monks who are most at home in misty hills, contemplating "crimson leaves" and "azure depths." Like its Japanese cousin, the haiku, Chinese Zen poetry conveys pregnant images in spare structures that cascade into layers of emotion and rich associations. The Buddhism itself lies offstage, the poems recalling more of Thoreau or Whitman than Hui-neng or Nagarjuna. The translations here pause and flow like the originals, with poet-painter Paul Hansen's renderings of early Sung monks especially brilliant, outshining even the celebrated Burton Watson's translations of the Tang poet Ch'i Chi.

Single and distant from her family, she wants a husband and children of her own. One night, after yet another disastrous internet date, she turns on her police radio to help herself fall asleep&#x2014;and receives an alert that sends her to a puzzling crime scene. </p><p>Edith Hind&#x2014;a beautiful graduate student at Cambridge University and daughter of the surgeon to the Royal Family&#x2014;has been missing for nearly twenty-four hours. Her home offers few clues: a smattering of blood in the kitchen, her keys and phone left behind, the front door ajar but showing no signs of forced entry. Manon instantly knows that this case will be big&#x2014;and that every second is crucial to finding Edith alive. </p><p>The investigation starts with Edith&#x2019;s loved ones: her attentive boyfriend, her reserved best friend, her patrician parents. As the search widens and press coverage reaches a frenzied pitch, secrets begin to emerge about Edith&#x2019;s tangled love life and her erratic behavior leading up to her disappearance. With no clear leads, Manon summons every last bit of her skill and intuition to close the case, and what she discovers will have shocking consequences not just for Edith&#x2019;s family but for Manon herself.</p><p>Suspenseful and keenly observed, <em>Missing, Presumed</em> is a brilliantly twisting novel of how we seek connection, grant forgiveness, reveal the truth about who we are.</p></p><p><p>SUSIE STEINER is the author of <em>Missing, Presumed</em>.

Manon tells herself to focus on the man sitting opposite, whose name might be Brian but could equally be Keith, who is crossing his legs and his foot bangs her shin just where the bone is nearest the surface. She reaches down to rub it but he&#x2019;s oblivious.<br><br>&#x201c;Sensitive,&#x201d; his profile had said, along with an interest in military aircraft. She wonders now what on earth she was thinking when she arranged it, but then compatibility seemed no marker for anything. The last date with a town planner scored 78 percent&#x2014;�she&#x2019;d harbored such hopes; he even liked Thomas Hardy&#x2014;�yet Manon spent the evening flinching each time his spittle landed on her face, which was remarkably often.<br><br>Two years of Internet dating. It&#x2019;s fair to say they haven&#x2019;t flown by.<br><br>He&#x2019;s turned his face so the light hits the thumbprints on his glasses: petroleum-�purple eggs, the kind of oval spiral they dream of finding at a crime scene. He&#x2019;s talking about his job with the Rivers Authority while she looks up gratefully to the waiter who is filling their wineglasses&#x2014;�well, her glass, because her companion isn&#x2019;t drinking.<br><br>She&#x2019;s endured far worse than this, of course, like the one she traveled all the way to London for. &#x201c;Keep an open mind,&#x201d; Bri had urged. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know where the man of your dreams might pop up.&#x201d; He was tall and very thin and he stooped like an undertaker going up the escalator at Tate Modern&#x2014;�giving it his best Uriah Heep. Manon thought that escalator ride was never going to end, and when she finally got to the top, she turned without a word and came straight back down, leaving him standing at the summit, staring at her. She got on the first train out of King&#x2019;s Cross, back to Huntingdon, as if fleeing the scent of decomposing flesh. Every officer on the Major Incident Team knew that smell, the way it stuck to your clothes.<br><br>This one&#x2014;�she&#x2019;s looking at him now, whatever his name is, Darren or Barry&#x2014;�isn&#x2019;t so much morbid as effacing. He is talking about newts; she&#x2019;s vaguely aware of this. Now he&#x2019;s raising his eyebrows&#x2014;�&#x201c;Shopping trolleys!&#x201d;&#x2014;�and she supposes he&#x2019;s making a wry comment about how often they&#x2019;re dumped in streams. She really must engage.<br><br>&#x201c;So, one week till Christmas,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;How are you spending it?&#x201d;<br><br>He looks annoyed that she&#x2019;s diverted him from the flow of his rivers. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve a brother in Norwich,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;I go to him. He&#x2019;s got kids.&#x201d; He seems momentarily disappointed and she likes him the more for it.<br><br>&#x201c;Not an easy time, Christmas. When you&#x2019;re on your own, I mean.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We have a pretty good time, me and Col, once we crack open the beers. We&#x2019;re a right double act.&#x201d;<br><br>Perhaps his name&#x2019;s Terry, she thinks sadly. Too late to ask now. &#x201c;Shall we get the bill?&#x201d; He hasn&#x2019;t even asked about her name&#x2014;�and most men do (&#x201c;Manon, that&#x2019;s a funny name. Is it Welsh?&#x201d;)&#x2014;�but in a sense it&#x2019;s a relief, the way he just plows on.<br><br>The waiter brings the bill and it lies lightly curled on a white saucer with two mint imperials.<br><br>&#x201c;Shall we split it?&#x201d; says Manon, throwing a card onto the saucer. He is sucking on a mint, looking at the bill.<br><br>&#x201c;To be fair,&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t have any wine. Here.&#x201d; He shows her the items on the bill that were hers&#x2014;�carafe of red and a side salad.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, right, OK,&#x201d; she says, while he gets out his phone and begins totting up. The windows are fogged and Manon peers at the misty halos of Huntingdon&#x2019;s festive lights. It&#x2019;ll be a cold walk home past the shuttered-�up shops on the high street, the sad, beery air emanating from Cromwell&#x2019;s, and out toward the river, its refreshing green scent and its movement a slithering in the darkness, to her flat, where she has left all the lights burning.<br><br>&#x201c;Yours comes to twenty-�three eighty-�five. Mine&#x2019;s only eleven pounds,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;D&#x2019;you want to check?&#x201d;<br><br>Midnight, and Manon sits with her knees up on the window seat, looking down at the snowy street lit by orange streetlamps. Flakes float down on their leisurely journey, buffeting, tissue-�light. The freezing draft coming in through the sash frame makes her hug her knees to her chest as she watches him&#x2014;�Frank? Bernard?&#x2014;�round the corner of her street and disappear.<br><br>When she&#x2019;s sure he&#x2019;s gone, she walks a circuit of the lounge, turning off the lamps. To give him credit, he was stopped short by her flat&#x2014;�&#x201c;Whoa, this is where you live?&#x201d;&#x2014;�but his interest was short-�lived and he soon recommenced his monologue. Perhaps, now she comes to think of it, she slept with him to shut him up.<br><br>The walls of the lounge are Prussian blue. The shelving on which the television stands is fifties G Plan in walnut. Her sofa is a circular design in brown corduroy. Two olive-�green velvet wing chairs sit to each side of it and beside one is a yellow-�domed seventies floor lamp, which she has just switched off at the plug because the switch is busted. The d�cor is a homage to mid-�century modern, like a film set, with every detail of a piece. The scene for a post-�ironic East German comedy perhaps, or Abigail&#x2019;s Party; a place absolutely bursting with taste of a charismatic kind, all of it chosen by the flat&#x2019;s previous owners. Manon bought the lot&#x2014;�furniture, lamps, and all&#x2014;�together with the property itself, from a couple who were going abroad to &#x201c;start afresh.&#x201d; At least, that&#x2019;s what the man had said. &#x201c;We just want to shed, you know?&#x201d; To which Manon replied, &#x201c;Shed away. I&#x2019;ll take the lot.&#x201d; And his girlfriend looked around her, swallowing down her tears. She told Manon how she&#x2019;d collected all of it, lovingly, on eBay. &#x201c;Still, fresh start,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>Manon makes her way to the bedroom, which at the point of sale was even more starkly dramatic: dark navy walls with white-�painted floorboards and shutters; a whole bank of white wardrobes, handle-�less and disappearing into themselves. You had to do a Marcel Marceau impression to discover the pressure points at which to open them.<br><br>The previous owners had a minimalist mattress on the floor and a disheveled white duvet. Under Manon&#x2019;s tenure, however, this room has lost much of its allure: books stacked by the bed, covered with a film of dust; a cloudy glass of water; wires trailing the floor from her police radio to the plug, and among them gray fluff and human hair, coiling like DNA. Her motley collection of shoes makes opening the cupboards additionally tricky. She kicks at a discarded pair of pants on the floor, rolled about themselves like a croissant, throws off her dressing gown (100 percent polyester, keep away from fire and flame), and retrieves, from under the bedclothes in which he has incongruously lain, her flannelette nightie.<br><br>Up close he smelled musty. And vaguely sweet. But above all, foreign. Was this her experiment&#x2014;�bringing him close, out of the world of strangers? Was she trying him out? Or smelling him out, as if intimacy might transform him into something less ordinary? People who know her&#x2014;�well, Bryony mainly&#x2014;�disapprove of her emotional &#x201c;immaturity,&#x201d; but the fact is human beings are different up close. You find out more through smell and touch than any chat about newts or shopping trolleys. She becomes her mammalian self, using her senses to choose a mate. She&#x2019;s read somewhere that smell is the most efficient way of selecting from the gene pool to ensure the best immune system in offspring. So she puts out on the first date! She&#x2019;s a scientist at the mating frontline.<br><br>In her darker moments&#x2014;�and she can feel their approach even now&#x2014;�she wonders if she is simply filling an awkward gap in the conversation. Instead of a ghastly shuffling of feet and &#x201c;Well, that was nice, but we should probably leave it there,&#x201d; she forces the moment to its crisis. It&#x2019;s like running yourself over to avoid shaking hands.<br><br>In the bathroom, she picks up her toothbrush and lays along it a slug of toothpaste, watching herself in the mirror as she brushes. Here is the flaw in her argument: the sex was pretty much a reflection of the night&#x2019;s conversation&#x2014;�all newts and shopping trolleys and a definite lack of tumultuous waterfalls or even babbling brooks, if you wanted to pursue the waterways analogy.<br><br>She looks at the springy coils of her hair, bobbing ringlets, brown mostly but with the odd blond one poking out like a rogue pasta twirl&#x2014;�spit&#x2014;�unruly and energetic, as if she is some child in a playground, and discordant now&#x2014;�spit&#x2014;�that she is on the cusp of her forties. She can feel herself gliding into that invisible&#x2014;�gargle&#x2014;�phase of womanhood, alongside those pushing prams or pulling shopping wheelies. She is drawn to the wider fittings in Clarks, has begun to have knee trouble, and is disturbed to find that clipping her toenails leaves her vaguely out of puff. She wonders what other indignities aging will throw at her and how soon. A few centuries ago she&#x2019;d be dead, having had eight children by the age of twenty-�five. Nature doesn&#x2019;t know what to do with a childless woman of thirty-�nine, except throw her that fertility curveball&#x2014;�aches and pains combined with extra time, like some terrifying end to a high-�stakes football match.<br><br>She wipes a blob of foam off her chin with a towel. Eventually, he asked about her name (her moment in the sun!) and she told him it meant &#x201c;bitter&#x201d; in Hebrew, and she lay back on the pillow, remembering how her mother had squeezed her secondary-�school shoulders and told her how much she&#x2019;d loved it, how &#x201c;Manon&#x201d; was her folly, much as her father objected. A Marmite name, you either loved it or loathed it, and her mother loved it, she said, because it was &#x201c;all held down,&#x201d; those &#x201c;n&#x201d;s like tent pegs in the ground.<br><br>There was silence, in which she supposed he wanted her to ask about his name, which she couldn&#x2019;t really, because she wasn&#x2019;t sure what it was. She could have said, &#x201c;What about yours?&#x201d; as a means of finding out, but by that point it seemed unnecessary. She had smelled him out and found him wanting. Her mind was set on how to get him out of her flat, which she did by saying, &#x201c;Right, then, early start tomorrow,&#x201d; and holding open her bedroom door.<br><br>She smooths out the pillow and duvet where he&#x2019;s been and pushes her feet down under the covers, reaching out an arm from the bed to switch on the radio, with its sticker reminding her it remains &#x201c;Property of Cambridgeshire Police.&#x201d; A cumbersome bit of kit, and no one at detective sergeant rank is supposed to have one at home, but it is not a plaything. It is the method by which she overcomes insomnia. Some rely on the shipping forecast; Manon prefers low murmurings about road traffic accidents or drunken altercations outside Level 2 Nightclub on All Saints Passage, all of which she can safely ignore because they are far too lowly for the Major Incident Team.<br><br>&#x201c;VB, VB, mobile unit to Northern Bypass, please; that&#x2019;s the A141, junction with Main Street. UDAA.&#x201d;<br><br>Unlawfully Driving Away an Automobile. Someone&#x2019;s nicked some wheels. Off you pop, Plod. The voice begins to sound very far away as Manon&#x2019;s eyelids grow heavy, the burbling of the radio merging into a pebbly blur behind her eyes. The clicks, switches, whirring, receivers picked up and put down, colleagues conferred with, buttons pressed to receive. To Manon, it is the sound of vigilance, this rapid response to hurt and misdeed. It is human kindness in action, protecting the good against the bad. She sleeps.<br><br>Sunday<br><br>Miriam<br><br>Miriam is washing up, looking out over the bleak winter garden&#x2014;�the lawn smooth as Christmas icing. She&#x2019;d have liked a bigger garden, but this is about as good as it gets in Hampstead.<br><br>She&#x2019;s thinking about Edith, her hands inside rubber gloves in the sink, washing up the Le Creuset after lunch&#x2019;s monkfish stew. The pancetta has stuck around the edges and she is going at it with a scourer. She&#x2019;s so lucky, she thinks, to have a girl, because girls look after you when you get old. Boys just leave home, eventually going to live cheek by jowl with their mothers-�in-�law.<br><br>And then she curses herself, because it goes against all her feminist principles&#x2014;�requiring her daughter, her clever Cambridge-�educated daughter, to wipe her wrinkly old bottom and bring her meals and audiobooks, probably while juggling toddlers and some pathetic attempt at a career. Her own career hadn&#x2019;t recovered from having the children, those three days a week at the GP surgery feeling like time-�filling in between bouts of household management.<br><br>Feminism, she thinks, has a long way to go before men take on the detritus of family life&#x2014;�not the spectacular bread and butter pudding, brought out to &#x201c;oohs&#x201d; and &#x201c;aahs&#x201d; (which always has the whiff of Man makes pudding! Round of applause!), but ordering bin liners and making sure there are enough lightbulbs. When the children were little, Miriam felt as if she were being buried under sand drifts from the Sahara: music lessons, homework folders, kids&#x2019; parties, thank-�you notes, fresh fruit, and meter readings. It silted up the corners of her mind until there was no space for anything else. Ian sidestepped it with strategic incompetence so that his mind remained free to focus on Important Things (such as work, or reading an interesting book). It was one of the biggest shocks of adult life&#x2014;�the injustice&#x2014;�and no one had warned her about it, certainly not her mother, who felt it was only right and proper that Miriam take on the more organizational tasks in life because she was &#x201c;so good at them.&#x201d; She&#x2019;d better not think about it now, or she&#x2019;ll get too angry.<br><br>She lifts the Le Creuset onto the white ceramic draining board, wondering why people rave about the things when they are almost un-�lift-�able and scratch everything they touch. Ian hasn&#x2019;t made it home for lunch so she&#x2019;s eaten the stew by herself, struggling to lift the damn heavy pot in order to pour the remains into a Tupperware box and struggling also not to feel hard done by. She&#x2019;s alone so much these days, in part because when the sand drifts receded, along with the departure of the children, they left an excess of time, while Ian&#x2019;s existence maintained its steady course, which was essentially Rushing About, Being Important. She has to fight, very often, not to take umbrage at the separations and also their converse, to retain some sense of herself in their togetherness.

He lives in Missoula, Montana.The section headings for the nonfictional and fictional entries in this anthology (``Journalistic Lies'' and ``Fictional Truths'') betray Crumley's bias regarding the blurred distinction between the two. Most of the pieces reflect the West that has been the writer's home: a land of men, cars and a greed that has left visible marks on the landscape, from the killing of the buffalo to the ``air-conditioned paradise on the Gulf Coast plain'' known as Houston. The stories read like sketches for lengthier works. In fact, two of the best entries (the title piece, set in Crumley's native South Texas, and the ``The Mexican Tree Duck,'' a detective tale) are beginnings of book-length works in progress. Crumley's ( The Last Good Kiss ) stories are earthy and often unnerving, the characters people who seek to flee their past only to find it waiting for them at their destination. In ``Three Cheers for Thomas J. Rabb,'' for instance, a football hero who accidentally kills an opponent on the gridiron is drafted into the army only to find events repeating themselves--not once but twice. <p></p><p>Copyright 1991 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Quartermaster: Montgomery C.

Meigs, who built the Union Army, was judged by Lincoln, Seward, and Stanton to be the indispensable architect of the Union victory. Civil War historian James McPherson calls Meigs &#x201c;the unsung hero of northern victory.&#x201d;<br><br>Born to a well to do, connected family in 1816, Montgomery C. Meigs graduated from West Point as an engineer. He helped build America&#x2019;s forts and served under Lt. Robert E. Lee to make navigation improvements on the Mississippi River. As a young man, he designed the Washington aqueducts in a city where people were dying from contaminated water. He built the spectacular wings and the massive dome of the brand new US Capitol.<br> <br>Introduced to President Lincoln by Secretary of State William Seward, Meigs became Lincoln&#x2019;s Quartermaster. It was during the Civil War that Meigs became a national hero. He commanded Ulysses S. Grant&#x2019;s base of supplies that made Union victories, including Gettysburg, possible. He sustained Sherman&#x2019;s army in Georgia, and the March to the Sea. After the war, Meigs built Arlington Cemetery (on land that had been Robert E.

He lives with his wife and son in Arlington, Virginia.The Quartermaster CHAPTER 1<p></p> Rigid Duty<p></p> <br>Montgomery Cunningham Meigs was born on May 3, 1816, in Augusta, Georgia. His father, Dr. Charles Meigs, a recent graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, with his new bride, Mary, had come to Augusta to start his medical career and raise a family in an atmosphere of piety. They lived not far from the Savannah River, optimistic about their prospects. But it soon became clear to the couple they could not stay in the South. The brutality of slavery made Mary ill. So they returned to Philadelphia, a bustling business center quickly filling with schools, churches, and businesses. It retained the charm of a provincial city, giving way quickly to unspoiled countryside. About sixty-three thousand residents relied on wood to heat their homes. Farmers brought food to the city by wagons. The city offered the Meigs family an affordable place to live, study, work, and grow. Montgomery and his six brothers and two sisters explored nearby rivers and forests. He loved to romp along the Delaware River with friends, examining the creatures he found in the mud and water. Sometimes in the summer, he fished until dark on the Schuylkill River. Now and then his family took sailing excursions to nearby farms.<br> <br>Montgomery was bright and affectionate and &#x201c;seems to observe everything that passes,&#x201d; his mother wrote in 1822, when he was six. But he also pained his family. He &#x201c;very soon tires of his play things,&#x201d; she wrote. &#x201c;Destroying them appears to afford him as much pleasure as their first possession&#x2014;is not vexed with himself for having broken them. Is very inquisitive about the use of everything, delighted to see different machines at work.&#x201d; When playing, he tended to be bossy. His mother described him as &#x201c;high tempered, unyielding, tyrannical towards his brothers; persevering in pursuit of anything he wishes.&#x201d;<br> <br>Meigs&#x2019;s father demanded discipline and excellence from the children. His stories were laden with moral lessons. The children often gathered around him near the fireplace and listened as he told them about their virtuous and industrious ancestors. The stories begin at the great Puritan migration in the 1630s, when the first of the clan arrived in Boston from England. The ancestors were educators, doctors, engineers, soldiers, and public officials. They were ambitious, patriotic, and pious. A certain righteousness also reappeared from generation to generation, much to the annoyance of neighbors and colleagues. Dr. Meigs in his stories underscored the importance of personal honor. He told the children it was their &#x201c;rigid duty&#x201d; to protect the family name. They were to &#x201c;beware lest [they] disgrace that history.&#x201d; In a note inscribed at the end of the family Bible, he wrote: Discard &#x201c;without mercy every member of their blood line whose conduct might stain&#x201d; the family reputation.<br> <br>His father challenged Meigs in other ways. He taught at Jefferson Medical College and became a pathbreaker in the realm of women&#x2019;s health, writing books on obstetrics while maintaining regular hours for patients. He shouldered an extraordinary workload, often snatching only two or three hours of sleep on the family couch before going to work. Charles Meigs didn&#x2019;t seem to mind. He felt called to service and thought his medical work put him closer to God. Montgomery Meigs would credit his mother&#x2019;s influence for much of his success, but he would never lose sight of the model set by his father.<br> <br>As a boy, Meigs watched militia companies march by on Chestnut Street in Philadelphia. He heard how Stephen Decatur, the American naval hero, had offered the toast &#x201c;My country&#x2014;right or wrong!&#x201d; He dreamed of going to the United States Military Academy at West Point, in New York, where he could train as a soldier and engineer. He was accepted in 1832, when he was sixteen, and he was awed by the outpost perched on a bluff in the forested mountains of the Hudson Highlands.<br> <br>Meigs studied mathematics, engineering, and building. One teacher insisted that every soldier know how to draw for mapmaking, and Meigs was soon able to do so with unusual finesse. Though he thrived as a student, he racked up demerits for cutting against what he later called West Point&#x2019;s &#x201c;uncompromising devotion to orthodoxy.&#x201d; He complained about the demerit system, saying it impeded enterprising men in favor of &#x201c;the stolid, the namby pamby, the men having no distinguishing traits or character.&#x201d; In 1836 Meigs graduated fifth in his class and became a second lieutenant in the army, dedicating himself to God, family, country, duty, honor. He joined the artillery corps but gave up that commission a year later to become a brevet second lieutenant in the Army Corps of Engineers, an elite organization that played a primary role in building the young country&#x2019;s roads, canals, bridges, and harbors. Its achievements included the country&#x2019;s longest highway, the Cumberland Road, west of the Ohio River.<br> <br>In the summer of 1837, one of his first assignments paired him with another West Point graduate, Robert E. Lee, class of 1829. Their task was to find ways of improving navigation on the Mississippi River. Meigs and Lee, his superior, set up headquarters on an abandoned steamboat about 150 miles to the north of St. Louis. Part of the deck was under water, but the staterooms were dry. Meigs drew and painted the countryside as part of mapmaking responsibilities. Lee directed a survey of the river and oversaw preliminary work of laborers to clear the river bottom. Meigs loved nearly everything about the assignment. For a time, the men bunked in a cabin onshore and ate the catfish and pike they caught. Meigs admired Lee, &#x201c;then in the vigor of youthful strength, with a noble and commanding presence, and an admirable, graceful, and athletic figure. He was one with whom nobody ever wished or ventured to take a liberty, though kind and generous to his subordinates, admired by all women, and respected by all men. He was the model of a soldier and the beau ideal of a Christian man.&#x201d;<br> <br>With harsh winter weather coming on, Meigs and Lee disbanded their crew. Meigs went back to Philadelphia; Lee, to his wife&#x2019;s plantation at Arlington, Virginia, in the hills overlooking Washington. They would remain fond of each other until a national crisis turned them into mortal enemies.</p><h2>How to Be Idle</h2><p><p>With advice, information, and reflection on such matters as lying in, long lunches, the art of the nap, and how to skive, <strong>How to Be Idle</strong> gives you all the inspiration you need to take a break from your fast-paced, overworked life.</p><p>From the founding editor of the <em>The Idler</em>, the celebrated magazine about the freedom and fine art of doing nothing, comes not simply a book, but an antidote to our work-obsessed culture. In <strong>How to Be Idle</strong>, Tom Hodgkinson presents his learned yet whimsical argument for a new universal standard of living: being happy doing nothing. He covers a whole spectrum of issues affecting the modern idler -- sleep, work, pleasure, relationships -- bemoaning the cultural skepticism of idleness while reflecting on the writing of such famous apologists for it as Oscar Wilde, Robert Louis Stevenson, Dr. Johnson, and Nietzsche -- all of whom have admitted to doing their very best work in bed.</p><p>It's a well-known fact that Europeans spend fewer hours at work a week than Americans. So it's only befitting that one of them -- the very clever, extremely engaging, and quite hilarious Hodgkinson -- should have the wittiest and most useful insights into the fun and nature of loafing.</p><p>Who wouldn't want to blow off work for a day and just "be idle"? The key to a life of pleasure, freedom, and guilt-free lounging around is in your hands.</p></p><p><p>Tom Hodgkinson is still doing what he's always done, which is a mixture of editing magazines, writing articles, and putting on parties. He was born in 1968, founded <em>The Idler</em> in 1993, and now lives in Devon, England. He is also the author of <em>The Freedom Manifesto</em>.</p>When your alarm clock jolts you awake in the morning, do you wish you could just lie in bed, read a book, sip a cup of tea and be idle all day? Hodgkinson, founder of the <i>Idler </i>magazine, does. And in this book he presents 24 essays defending life's idle pleasures, which are, he says, vilified by our modern society. He meditates on sleeping in, fishing, smoking and drinking, and even waxes poetic about the hangover. The whole book is soaked with nostalgia for the turn-of-the-century English gentleman's lifestyle; Hodgkinson defends his arguments by quoting Jerome K. Jerome, G.K. Chesterton and, of course, that icon of British foppery, Oscar Wilde. Although billed as tongue-in-cheek witticisms about the idle life, the book fails to maintain the comic tone. In his chapter on the evils of the 9-to-5 job ("wage slavery," as the author calls it), Hodgkinson cites Heinrich Himmler as a spokesperson for the defense of work [...] The book gives tantalizing anthropological insights into society's views on those lazy habits that the author so enjoys, but the viewpoint is so antiquated and condescending toward the poor slobs who must actually go to work every day that readers will often find themselves staring aghast at the page.

Many see it as an apocalyptic sign.<br><br>But is it?<br><br>In <i>The Twelfth Insight</i>, the long-awaited fourth book in the beloved Celestine Series, we again follow our Hero and his close friend Wil. They have just received a portion of another ancient and mysterious manuscript that describes a secret approach to spirituality that is silently arriving in the second decade of the 21st Century. But the manuscript is only available in fragments. <br><br>To understand its full meaning for mankind, our Hero and Wil begin an urgent search to find the message in its entirety. As they embrace the power of Synchronicity and begin their search, they are confronted by powerful political forces and religious extremists that stand in the way of these spiritual revelations. <br><br>Utilizing what he calls the "parable effect," and based on his own sources, James Redfield explores the similarities and differences that exist among the world religions, revealing the essential messages contained within them that can energize our experience of spirituality-- and produce a new wave of integrity and reform that can transform our lives and our world.<br><br></p><p>James Redfield is an American author, lecturer, screenwriter and film producer.New Age spiritual popularizer Redfield ruled the best-seller lists in the 1990s with his Celestine series of adventure parables, then left readers hanging after The Secret of Shambhala: In Search of the Eleventh Insight (1999). He now resurrects searcher Wilson James, known as Wil, and his fellow traveler, the unnamed narrator, just in time to offer a positive spin on the Mayan prophecy for the year 2012. A mysterious Document is being released around the world with instructions on how to use powers of the mind and spirit to elevate world consciousness and usher in not doomsday but, rather, a time of unity and peace. Redfield suggests that current economic crises, religious extremism, and political polarization are signs that we must change our ways. But Wil, the narrator, and a band of neatly diverse seekers (a Jew, a Muslim, a scientist, a few Christians, and a few Native Americans) must attain enlightenment immediately (instant karma, anyone?) in order to stop a band of terrorists from detonating a suitcase nuke. Celestine-heads and others looking for miraculous fables will embrace this hokey yet hopeful spiritual action fantasy. HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: Redfields previous books dominated best-seller lists for years, and his return will stoke avid interest. --Donna Seaman</p><h2>Death in the Devil&#39;s Acre</h2><p>"Give her a good murder and a shameful social evil, and Anne Perry can write a Victorian mystery that would make Dickens's eyes pop."<br>NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW<br>When a doctor is found brutally murdered, even the neighborhood's most hardened residents are stunned.

Both church leaders and laypersons seem to believe that the psychological "experts" have the answers for the wounded hearts and souls of God's people. And when churches do offer counseling, it often is tinged with the secular psychology and psychotherapy that have infiltrated the church.</p> <p><em>Psychobabble</em> explains the dichotomy between secular and Biblical counseling and shows the danger of incorporating secular techniques into a Christian approach. This book will arm believers looking for Scriptural answers to the hurts of a broken world. As anti-Christian bias becomes increasingly pervasive in secular psychology, the church must look to the true source of all healing. This book will point the way.</p> <p><em>"Dr. Ganz threads through all the sticky issues as he confronts the psychological demigods of the Christian integrationists' pantheon and exposes their feet of clay. For those who have wondered whether the integration of secular psychotherapy with the revelation of God in the Bible is possible--here is your answer."</em> --Dr. Jay Adams, professor, Westminster Theological Seminary</p> <p><em>"Here is a solid Biblical approach to counseling from somebody who has seen it from both the psychological and Biblical sides. Anyone who does Biblical counseling should read this book."</em> --Dr. John F. MacArthur, Jr., pastor, author of <em>Ashamed of the Gospel</em></p> <p><em>"A vivid book by a Bible-believing Jewish-Christian ex-psychotherapist, full of precious wisdom as to how God's power transforms troubled lives."</em> --Dr. J. I. Packer, Professor of Theology, Regents College</p> <p><em>"At a time when much of the modern church seems to have replaced repentance with recovery, sanctification with serenity, and piety with therapy, Psychobabble is especially welcome--and needed. I pray that it will receive a wide reading."</em> --George Grant, author, Executive Director, Legacy Communications</p></p><p></p><h2>The Metamorphoses of Ovid: A New Verse Translation</h2><p>A new verse translation of the most famous work of a witty, irreverent Roman poet captures the mischievous spirit of this man of letters who wrote candid poems about love and suffered a death in exile.</p><p>Publius Ovidius Naso, whom we know as Ovid, was already established as a writer when The Metamorphoses was published in A.D. 8, when he was 52 years old. It had taken him a decade to compose his great poem, during which time he published little, but the Roman world was still abuzz with excitement over his richly erotic Art of Love. So, unfortunately, was the court of Augustus Caesar, and the emperor banished the poet to what is now Romania. Augustus may have taken exception to the poet's turn to the impolite realm of the body--or he may have objected to a rumored affair between Ovid and the emperor's nymphomaniacal daughter Julia, who figures so prominently in Robert Graves's Claudius novels. The poet who had declared Rome to be his only home could have found no worse punishment than exile, but no amount of pleading could sway Augustus, and Ovid died on the shores of the Black Sea a decade later. Full of veiled political and historical references, <i>The Metamorphoses</i> lived on to become a permanent fixture in the canon of European literature. In Allen Mandelbaum's hands, it lives on for a new generation.The Metamorphoses is a treasury of classical myths, filtered through the worldly and far from reverent sensibility of the Roman poet Ovid (43 B.C-A.D.17).</p><h2>Uplifting Prayers to Light Your Way: 200 Invocations for Challenging Times</h2><p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Several years ago, I underwent a particularly challenging time, facing&#x2014;only six weeks apart&#x2014;the unexpected deaths of my brother and my father.

By the author of Armor. Reissue.</p><p><i>Vampire$</i> (the title <i>does</i> end with a dollar sign) is about a tightly knit group of professional vampire killers. They may say they're in it for the money, but their death-defying bravado and warm male friendships are as intense as those in any soldier-hero epic. The irrepressible, foul-mouthed, hard-drinkin' Jack Crow--decked out in high-tech chain mail and wielding a fearsome crossbow--is the leader of the bunch. He's the sort of man who screams obscenities at the pope, and then (after a lot of booze) weeps in the pontiff's lap over the horrors he's witnessed. <p> Author John Steakley is the son of a Chevrolet dealer from Cleburne, Texas, and he uses his roots to good effect. Not only does much of the action take place in the Lone Star state, but when we first meet the major character named Felix, he's an apparition out of the Old West--living in an abandoned boxcar on the Rio Grande with a Mexican whore, an endless supply of tequila, and a tacky bleeding Jesus on the wall. </p><p> <i>Vampire$</i> is one gaudy, action-packed novel.

Her work represents a dialogue between abstract principles and her sensory-response to the visible world.</p><p>When the young poets David Lehman splendidly limns in <i>The Last Avant-Garde</i> arrived in New York, they all met the ebullient Nell Blaine, who was making her name with colorful abstractions that showed the influence of the famous painter-teacher Hans Hofmann in their strong geometric compositional grounding and of Leger in their bold lines. But abstract expressionism was already the biggest game in town, and Blaine soon reacted to it. Turning to landscape, portrait, still life, and genre subjects, she replaced strong outline with sculptural brushwork to define objects but kept the geometric underpinnings and the brilliant coloration of her abstractions. Thus she forged a ravishingly attractive style, gorgeously displayed here, that survived even severe crippling by polio in 1959, after which Blaine, hitherto famous for nearly running while she worked, was confined to a wheelchair and had restricted use of her right arm. Sawin tells Blaine's story and discusses her art simultaneously, with extracts from Blaine's own writing adding veracity and verve. <i>Ray Olson</i></p><h2>In Wartime: Stories from Ukraine</h2><p><b>From one of the finest journalists of our time comes a definitive, boots-on-the-ground dispatch from the front lines of the conflict in Ukraine.</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Ever since Ukraine&#x2019;s violent 2014 revolution, followed by Russia&#x2019;s annexation of Crimea, the country has been at war.

In his book 1984 George Orwell famously wrote: &#x201c;He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.&#x201d; The war in Ukraine is not about history, but without using or, to employ the fashionable term, &#x201c;weaponizing&#x201d; history, the conflict simply could not be fought. There is nothing unique about this. In our times, in Europe, history was deployed as the advance guard and recruiting sergeant in the run-up to the Yugoslav wars, and exactly the same has happened again in Ukraine. In this way people are mobilized believing horrendously garbled versions of history. On the Russian and rebel side, fear is instilled by summoning up the ghosts of the past and simply ignoring inconvenient historical truths. On the Ukrainian side, the ugliest parts of history are ignored, as though they never happened, thus giving the enemy more propaganda ammunition to fire.<br><br>In this conflict the words &#x201c;info-war&#x201d; or &#x201c;information war&#x201d; have replaced the word &#x201c;propaganda.&#x201d; In one way that is fitting because fighting the info-war is more complicated than disseminating old-fashioned propaganda. The battlefields include Facebook, Twitter, vKontakte (the Russian equivalent of Facebook) and YouTube. On news and other websites tens of thousands of people &#x201c;comment&#x201d; on articles in such a way as to make them feel as though they are doing something useful. They are, as a boy who was about to start military training in Kharkiv told me, &#x201c;sofa warriors.&#x201d; But some it seems are mercenaries too. According to numerous reliable reports, the Russian authorities contract firms to employ people to &#x201c;comment&#x201d; and spread, among other things, the central line of Russian propaganda, which is that the Ukrainian government, after the Maidan revolution, is nothing but Nazism reincarnated.<br><br>What is odd is how much rubbish people believe, disregarding what they must know from their own experiences or those of their families. What has happened on the Russian side of the info-war, especially, bears close resemblance to the experience of Serbs in the early 1990s. Then, most of their media painted all Croats as Ustashas, after their wartime fascist movement, and Bosnian Muslims as jihadis. While of course, just as there were indeed then some admirers of the Ustashas, and some jihadis too, just as there are admirers of Ukraine&#x2019;s wartime fascists now, the big lie is to give them a significance they didn&#x2019;t and don&#x2019;t have. As in the Balkans, the same is happening again: in Russia all of the mainstream media is following the modern party line. As the rebels seized control of eastern regions of Ukraine in April 2014, they moved quickly to take over local TV buildings and transmission facilities, turning off Ukrainian channels and tuning in to Russian ones. On the other side of the line, Russian channels were switched off and removed from cable packages. However, in the age of satellite TV and the Internet, it is not possible to deprive everyone of all information, bar that which you want them to see, but it is nevertheless remarkable how people so often accept what they are told. In this story, or &#x201c;narrative&#x201d; to use the technical term, history is something of a foundation and bedrock and this is why rewriting history&nbsp;is as important as writing the news. What you believe today depends on what you believe about the past. In that sense it is important for the &#x201c;political technologists,&#x201d; to use the pithy and apt term popular in post-Soviet countries, who might be understood by Westerners as turbo-spin doctors, to fashion a past which suits the future they are trying to create.<br><br>When Vladimir Putin, Russia&#x2019;s triumphant president, spoke on March 18, 2014, to his parliament, the Duma, and other Russian leaders and announced the annexation of Crimea following its referendum, which took place with no free debate and was rammed through under the watchful eyes of armed men and Russian soldiers, he repeated the line that maybe even he believes, but certainly many Russians and those in rebel-held territory believe. There had been a coup d&#x2019;�tat in Kiev against the lawfully elected government of President Yanukovych executed by &#x201c;nationalists, neo-Nazis, Russophobes and anti-Semites.&#x201d; Some of these there were, just as there are plenty of the same on the Russian and rebel side, but to tar the whole revolution in this way made sense only to people who actually wanted to believe it. For supporters from Western countries and other foreign admirers of Putin and the rebels, it also provided what seemed like a noble &#x201c;anti-fascist&#x201d; cause to belong to, rather than subscribing to an invented and racist interpretation of events in which all Ukrainians were fascists and the Russians or the rebels were heroic liberators. &#x201c;We can all clearly see the intentions of these ideological heirs of [Stepan] Bandera,&#x201d; said Putin, &#x201c;Hitler&#x2019;s accomplice during the Second World War.&#x201d;<br><br>In Kiev I talked with Professor Grigory Perpelytsia, a former Soviet naval man, who now teaches at the Foreign Ministry&#x2019;s Diplomatic Academy. We walked down the hill from the academy and ducked into a dark restaurant serving hearty old-fashioned Ukrainian cuisine, meaning mostly large portions of meat. Putin, he said, wanted Russian troops to be welcomed with &#x201c;flowers and songs&#x201d;&#x2014;as they were by many in Crimea, though anyone who did not feel this way was hardly likely to be on the streets. In order to achieve this, he said, Putin had launched an info-war against &#x201c;Ukrainian fascists&#x201d; and Banderovtsi. Many were receptive to this kind of message,&nbsp;he explained, especially older people in Russia and to a certain extent in Ukraine, because many still retained a Soviet mentality, &#x201c;want to go back to the USSR&#x201d; and perceived Russia to be its inheritor. To burnish this image Russia exploited the victory of the Second World War and the symbols of the USSR, which disoriented people and confused them. In Ukraine, all this served to consolidate divisions which already existed. One of the great failings of the modern Ukrainian state is that it has never been able to create an all-encompassing post-Soviet narrative of modern Ukrainian history that was broadly accepted by most, if not all. The modern Ukrainian state has no common soundtrack of history, which for Britain for example includes Churchill telling Britons they would fight on the beaches and in the hills, or de Gaulle telling the French that they had lost a battle but not the war. Reality might have been more complex, but nevertheless there are no serious challenges to these modern narratives&#x2014;even in France, where there was plenty of collaboration. In Ukraine&#x2019;s case, however, the story is different and, as the conflict has shown, two baleful figures loom over it, those of Bandera and Stalin. Understanding this is essential to understanding Ukraine today.</p><h2>A Searching Heart (Prairie Legacy Series #2)</h2><p>Virginia Simpson&#39;s faith is tested when troubles come her way at the end of her time in college, including the medical problems that complicate her sister&#39;s first delivery and the Dear Jane letter she receives from her boyfriend</p><p>The Yearning Deep Inside Her--to Go Somewhere, Discover Something, Be a Part of the World About Her in a New Way--Would Not Go Away.

Evenson. </p>1<br>&nbsp;<br><br>WHEN THEY FIRST WOKE HIM, he had the impression of the world becoming real again and he himself along with it. He did not remember having been stored. He could remember nothing about what his life had been before the Kollaps, and the days directly before they had stored him were foggy at best, little more than a few frozen images. He remembered tatters of the Kollaps itself, had a fleeting glimpse of himself panting and in flight, riots, gunfire, rubble. He remembered a bright blast, remembered awakening to find himself burned and naked as a newborn&#x2014;or perhaps even more naked, since all the hair had been singed from his body or had simply fallen out. He remembered feeling amazed to be alive, but, well, he was alive, it was hard to question that, wasn&#x2019;t it?<br>And then what? People: he had found them, or they had found him, hard to say which. A few men banded together, acting &#x201c;rationally&#x201d; instead of &#x201c;like animals,&#x201d; as one of them must have put it, attempting to found a new society, attempting to start over.<br><i>Not having learned better,</i> he thought grimly, <i>the first time.</i><br>Was it all coming back to him? He wasn&#x2019;t sure. And how much of what was coming back was real?<br>What was his name again?<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>AT FIRST HE COULDN&#x2019;T FEEL his body at all. He heard noise around him, the low rumble of ordinary mortals muttering to one another, the scuff of feet against a floor around what must be his receptacle. He tried to move his mouth and found he couldn&#x2019;t, that he couldn&#x2019;t even feel it, that he wasn&#x2019;t even completely certain that he had a mouth. It made him nervous. He tried to lick his lips, but either nothing happened or something happened that he couldn&#x2019;t feel.<br>His eyelids were closed, but there was the slightest gap between them. He could just see out, could see light, a slight blurriness of semi-differentiated figures, nothing more. He tried to will his eyes open further, failed. Nor could he move the eyes themselves: they stayed staring, fixed, his mind very clumsily processing the thin slit of reality available to them.<br>He tried to swallow, but couldn&#x2019;t move his throat. <i>Am I breathing?</i> he wondered, but figured that no, he was in storage, he wasn&#x2019;t breathing, wouldn&#x2019;t breathe until he was fully awake. Assuming he understood the process properly, he was still frozen. He shouldn&#x2019;t be experiencing anything at all yet, shouldn&#x2019;t even be able to think. Why could he?<br><i>Horkai,</i> he thought suddenly. <i>Josef Horkai.</i> That was his name. It came, flashing back and forth and painfully through him. He tried to keep hold of the name, tried to wrap it around himself and tie it in place with something else, some other fact, anything.<br><i>Horkai,</i> he thought. <i>Occupation? Before the Kollaps? Now?</i><br>Nothing came. <i>Be patient,</i> he told himself. <i>Let things come as they will.</i><br>And then the name flopped away, vanished in darkness. He tried again to blink, and one eyelid closed fully and held there. The other remained as it was, slit open, but the pupil behind it began to slide, smearing away the little bit of blurred vision he had and coming to rest against the backlit inside of the lid.<br>He sensed something on the horizon, in the vague redness, coming toward him. His eyelid slid open a little, but he couldn&#x2019;t tell if he had done it or if it had been done to him.<br>And then there was a roaring and what was coming arrived and turned out to be pain, madly beating its wings. He hurt like hell, every part of him, and since he could not tell where he ended and the rest of the world began, it felt like the entire world was awash in fire. And still he couldn&#x2019;t move, couldn&#x2019;t cry out, couldn&#x2019;t take air into his lungs, nothing. It was terrible, as terrible as anything he had ever felt.<br>And then slowly it receded, melted away, leaving in its wake a slow twisting and turning of naked sensation that refused to drain off. He could feel parts of himself now, though those parts still felt awkward and dampened, as if wrapped in gauze. One of his eyes sprang open and he could see a blurred thumb and forefinger sheathed in latex holding the eyelids apart. Behind and past them, an arm and vague shapes, several of them, that he guessed to be human. Similar to human, anyway. And then suddenly a blazing circle of light.<br>&#x201c;Pupil contracts,&#x201d; he heard someone say. A male voice, hoarse, similar to the one he had heard earlier. &#x201c;Vision&#x2019;s probably okay.&#x201d;<br>The blazing circle disappeared, its afterimage tracking across his vision and the figures resolved briefly into being. And then the thumb and forefinger let go and he saw only the inside of his eyelid again.<br>&#x201c;What was that?&#x201d; asked someone new, in a distracted voice.<br>None of the voices sounded familiar. Then again, why should they?<br>&#x201c;I said,&#x201d; the first voice said, louder this time, &#x201c;that he&#x2019;ll probably be able to see.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not what you said.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;<i>Vision&#x2019;s probably okay,</i> I said. Amounts to the same thing.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Have it your way,&#x201d; said the other. &#x201c;Hand me the hypodermic.&#x201d;<br>Silence. And then all at once the remnants of sensation that had been eddying seemed about to burst. All his nerves burned at once. He tried to scream but nothing came out.<br>He lay there immobile, certain he was dying, until, mercifully, like a candle, he was snuffed out.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2012 by Brian Evenson<br></p><h2>Reading 6 for Christian Schools: As Full as the World Student, 2nd Edition</h2><p>Reading 6 for Christian Schools.

What makes the newfound communities and purpose many find in the ruins and crises after disaster so joyous? And what does this joy reveal about ordinarily unmet social desires and possibilities?<br><br> In <i>A Paradise Built in Hell</i>, award-winning author Rebecca Solnit explores these phenomena, looking at major calamities from the 1906 earthquake in San Francisco through the 1917 explosion that tore up Halifax, Nova Scotia, the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, 9/11, and Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. She examines how disaster throws people into a temporary utopia of changed states of mind and social possibilities, as well as looking at the cost of the widespread myths and rarer real cases of social deterioration during crisis. This is a timely and important book from an acclaimed author whose work consistently locates unseen patterns and meanings in broad cultural histories.<br><br></p><p>Rebecca Solnit is the author of numerous books, including <i>Hope in the Dark</i>, <i>River of Shadows: Eadweard Muybridge and the Technological Wild West</i>, <i>Wanderlust: A History of Walking</i>, and <i>As Eve Said to the Serpent: On Landscape, Gender, and Art</i>, which was nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award in Criticism. In 2003, she received the prestigious Lannan Literary Award.Natural and man-made disasters can be utopias that showcase human solidarity and point the way to a freer society, according this stimulating contrarian study. Solnit (<i>River of Shadows</i>) reproves civil defense planners, media alarmists and Hollywood directors who insist that disasters produce terrified mobs prone to looting, murder and cannibalism unless controlled by armed force and government expertise. Surveying disasters from the 1906 San Francisco earthquake to 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina, she shows that the typical response to calamity is spontaneous altruism, self-organization and mutual aid, with neighbors and strangers calmly rescuing, feeding and housing each other. Indeed, the main problem in such emergencies, she contends, is the elite panic of officials who clamp down with National Guardsmen and stifling regulations. Solnit falters when she generalizes her populist brief into an anarchist critique of everyday society that lapses into fuzzy what-ifs and uplifting volunteer testimonials. Still, this vividly written, cogently argued book makes a compelling&#x2014;and timely&#x2014;case for the ability of ordinary people to collectively surmount the direst of challenges. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Slash spent his adolescence on the streets of Hollywood, discovering drugs, drinking, rock music, and girls, all while achieving notable status as a BMX rider. But everything changed in his world the day he first held the beat-up one-string guitar his grandmother had discarded in a closet.</p><p>The instrument became his voice and it triggered a lifelong passion that made everything else irrelevant. As soon as he could string chords and a solo together, Slash wanted to be in a band and sought out friends with similar interests. His closest friend, Steven Adler, proved to be a conspirator for the long haul. As hairmetal bands exploded onto the L.A. scene and topped the charts, Slash sought his niche and a band that suited his raw and gritty sensibility.</p><p>He found salvation in the form of four young men of equal mind: Axl Rose, Izzy Stradlin, Steven Adler, and Duff McKagan. Together they became Guns N' Roses, one of the greatest rock 'n' roll bands of all time. Dirty, volatile, and as authentic as the streets that weaned them, they fought their way to the top with groundbreaking albums such as the iconic&nbsp;<em>Appetite for Destruction</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Use Your Illusion I</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>II</em>.</p><p>Here, for the first time ever, Slash tells the tale that has yet to be told from the inside: how the band came together, how they wrote the music that defined an era, how they survived insane, never-ending tours, how they survived themselves, and, ultimately, how it all fell apart. This is a window onto the world of the notoriously private guitarist and a seat on the roller-coaster ride that was one of history's greatest rock 'n' roll machines, always on the edge of self-destruction, even at the pinnacle of its success. This is a candid recollection and reflection of Slash's friendships past and present, from easygoing Izzy to ever-steady Duff to wild-child Steven and complicated Axl.</p><p>It is also an intensely personal account of struggle and triumph: as Guns N' Roses journeyed to the top, Slash battled his demons, escaping the overwhelming reality with women, heroin, coke, crack, vodka, and whatever else came along.</p><p>He survived it all: lawsuits, rehab, riots, notoriety, debauchery, and destruction, and ultimately found his creative evolution.

Eight major topics are addressed including doubt, the problem of pain, and the existence of evil.</p><p>Award-winning reporter and author Lee Strobel (<i>The Case for Christ</i>) once again uses his investigative skills to address the primary objections to Christianity. As a former atheist, Strobel understands the rational resistance to faith. He even names the eight most convincing arguments against Christian faith: <blockquote> 1) If there's a loving God, why does this pain-wracked world groan under so much suffering and evil?<br> 2) If the miracles of God contradict science, then how can any rational person believe that they're true?<br> 3) If God is morally pure, how can he sanction the slaughter of innocent children as the Old Testament says he did?<br> 4) If God cares about the people he created, how could he consign so many of them to an eternity of torture in hell just because they didn't believe the right things about him?<br> 5) If Jesus is the only way to heaven, then what about the millions of people who have never heard of him?<br> 6) If God really created the universe, why does the evidence of science compel so many to conclude that the unguided process of evolution accounts for life?<br> 7) If God is the ultimate overseer of the church, why has it been rife with hypocrisy and brutality throughout the ages?<br> 8) If I'm still plagued by doubts, then is it still possible to be a Christian?<br> </blockquote> These are mighty tough questions, and Strobel fields them well. Rather than write a weighty dissertation about the merits of faith, he brings us along on his quest as we meet leaders in the Christian community, such as Peter Kreeft and William Lane Craig. We also encounter his everyday friends and acquaintances that serendipitously fill in the holes in each of the eight arguments against faith. The use of dialogue from personal interviews and a scene-by-scene active narrative makes this an easy and engaging read. However, easy does not mean breezy. This is a book of substance and merit, one that will help Christians defend their faith, especially during the hardest of times, when they have to defend their faith to themselves in moments of doubt. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>Lee Strobel, with a Master of Studies in Law degree from Yale, was an award-winning journalist for 13 years at the Chicago Tribune and other newspapers.

The Morton Arboretum in Lisle, Illinois, on the outskirts of Chicago, is one of the few institutions in the country that offers instruc-tion in botanical illustration on a regular basis. Over the years, Ms. Lerner had taken courses in botany, the local flora, birds of the Midwest, and other aspects of nature, but she hesitated to join the illustration class because the members seemed very accomplished. "Finally I gave it a try," she says. I continued attending for the next three years; then I felt ready to do something with my skills. I thought of illustrating children's books because they would offer more variety than strictly scientific illustration. "</p><p>Joshua and Jesse are Ms. Lerner's sons, now grown. "Initially my husband, Ralph, and I introduced them to birds and plants, but this realm of experience took such a tremendous grip on their interests and imaginations, they became expert birders [bird-watchers] and very savvy all-around naturalists on their own. All through their childhood years, their curiosity sparked my interest in the natural world."</p><p>The first book Ms. Lerner wrote and illustrated was <em>On the Forest Edge</em>. An ecological portrait of the animal and plant life found at the forest edge, it was given an award for Special Artistic Merit by the Friends of American Writers. Ms. Lerner's third, fourth, and fifth books, <em>Seasons of the Tallgrass Prairie, A Biblical Garden,</em> and <em>Pitcher Plants</em>, were named ALA Notable Books, as was <em>Tree Flowers</em>, which she illustrated. <em>Plant Families</em> was named a New York Academy of Sciences Honor Book. Among her recent titles are <em>Cactus, Dumb Cane</em> and <em>Daffodils, A Forest Year</em> and <em>Moonseed and Mistletoe,</em> all of which are NSTA/CBC Outstanding Science Trade Books for Children. Her critically acclaimed <em>Backyard Birds of Winter</em> has recently been followed by <em>Backyard Birds Of Summer</em>.</p><p>Carol and Ralph Lerner live in Chicago. Summers and weekends are spent at their house in rural Indiana, where they are surrounded by forests and wetlands. "Wild birds are at our doorstep. There's a swamp across the road that is frog heaven. And I finally have enough space to realize the garden of my dreams. I garden with a certain passion." The same passion is evident in Carol Lerner's fine ecological portraits.</p>Grade 3-6-A guide to identifying and observing birds that survive in the cold climate of the U.S. and southern Canada.

Simple backdrops unique to each one's natural habitat are set against white to create an open, airy format. Providing more information than is found in basic identification guides, Lerner's book describes requirements for survival, adaptation to cold temperatures, and diet as well as distinguishing physical characteristics. One section discusses the best seeds for individual species and well-designed feeders that attract birds and discourage squirrels. A valuable selection to include alongside Golden Guides, Peterson's guides, and Rob Hume's Birdwatching (Random, 1993), which includes more detailed advice for observing birds in all seasons.<br><i>Diane Nunn, Richard E.

In this deeply personal book, Father Ronald Rolheiser delves into the history and meaning of this sacred tradition, drawing upon the insights of various scripture scholars, theologians, and church teachings. With personal warmth and great insight, he reflects on his own particular Roman Catholic upbringing and the centrality that the Eucharist has within that tradition. At the same time, he looks at other denominations&#x2019; traditions around the Eucharist. <i>Our One Great Act of Fidelity</i> is an investigation into the ways people secure their faith and belief and discover true intimacy with God and each other. Ultimately, however, it is a spiritual and a personal statement of how Ronald Rolheiser understands the Eucharist and why he celebrates it every day.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Ronald Rolheiser is a specialist in the field of spirituality and is currently President of the Oblate School of Theology in San Antonio, Texas.

She ran to her parents' bedroom for safety. Her mother brought her back to her own room, put on a light to show her that there was nothing there, and gently tried to reassure her that she was safe. Then, just before leaving, the mother said to her, "You don't need to be afraid. You aren't alone. God is here in the room with you." The child replied, "I know that God is here with me, but I need someone here who has some skin!"<br><br>We are all like that little girl. As human beings we are sensual creatures in the true meaning of that term. We are creatures of the senses: touch, sight, hearing, smell, and taste. Everything that enters us goes through one of those five senses and everything that comes out of us, all communication and expression, comes out through one of those same senses. We are not angels, pure spirits without bodies. We are incarnate spirits, souls that have a body, and so we need things that we can touch, see, hear, taste, and smell.<br><br>That is true, too, sometimes especially so, in terms of our relationship to God. A God who is everywhere is, for us, at a certain point, nowhere. We are human. We need a God who has some skin, who can be located, who can somehow be physically touched. And God--who knows human nature, since he created it--respects that need in us and meets us on our own terms. Thus, the central tenet within Christianity, the very thing that defines it, is the belief that, in Christ, God took on concrete flesh and became tangible, physical, someone who can touch and be touched. Indeed the very word Christ ultimately means divine reality inside of human flesh.<br><br>When John wrote his Gospel, he did not include a Christmas story. In place of the birth of Jesus, he simply wrote, The word was made flesh and it lives among us. That single statement defines Christianity. Christianity isn't first and foremost a religion or a set of beliefs. Rather, parallel to the unfolding of the universe itself, it is an ongoing story, the story of God taking on physical flesh in this world, a story that began with the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem and that continues down to this very day. God is still taking on concrete flesh. How?<br><br>The mystery of God taking on concrete flesh, which Christians call the incarnation, isn't a simple thirty--three--year incursion of God into human history in the person of Jesus. It's more. God took on flesh in Jesus, but the incarnation didn't end when Jesus ascended back to the Father after his resurrection. The incarnation is still going on. God is still taking on concrete flesh in this world. Where?<br><br>In the Christian scriptures, the term the body of Christ is used to refer equally to three things: the historical body of Jesus, the body of believers, and the Eucharist. Each of these is referred to as the body of Christ. Each is the body of Christ. For instance, when Saint Paul refers to either the community of believers or the Eucharist, he never intimates that they are like Jesus, that they replace Jesus, that they are symbolic representations of Jesus, or even that they are a mystical presence of Jesus. Each is equally called the body of Christ, each is that place in our world where God takes on concrete flesh. God still has skin in this world, in the Eucharist and in the community of believers. The incarnation is still going on. The word is still becoming flesh and living among us.<br><br>That is the first, and the key, thing that must be said about the Eucharist. Along with the community of believers, the Eucharist is God's physical presence, God's real presence in the world. The Eucharist is the place where God continues to take concrete physical flesh just as he once did in the womb of Mary. In the Eucharist, the word continues to become flesh.<br><br>2<br><br>The CENTRALITY of the EUCHARIST<br><br>to the CHRISTIAN FAITH<br><br>Jesus didn't leave us a lot of rituals. He left us his Word1 and he left us one ritual, the Eucharist. He refers to other rituals such as baptism, and other parts of the Christian scriptures refer to the laying on of hands, to the confessing of sins, and to various kinds of anointing with oil, but Jesus, himself, left us only his Word and the Eucharist.<br><br>And it is around these two things, the Word and the Eucharist, that we form community; from these we create church. Historically Roman Catholics and Protestants have differed as to which of these to give the priority. In classical Protestant theology and practice, the Word is central; it is what first and foremost draws us into community. Eucharist might or might not follow. In Roman Catholicism, the Eucharist is given priority and the Word and all the other sacraments are ultimately in support of the Eucharist.2 In a vast oversimplification, it might be said that Roman Catholics form church around the Eucharist, while seeing the Word as a necessary prelude to and supplement to the Eucharist; whereas Protestants form church around the Word, while seeing the Eucharist as flowing out from that in different ways.<br><br>Partly this can be seen simply by walking into either a Roman Catholic or a Protestant church. When you walk into<br><br>a Protestant church, what is front and center? A pulpit or a lectern, something from which the Word of God is proclaimed and preached. Secondarily there might or might not be an altar, and if there is one, it is generally less centrally situated. The architecture speaks the theology: we gather first and foremost around the Word. The Eucharist takes a secondary place. When you walk into a Roman Catholic church the reverse is true: What is front and center? An altar. Off to one side, far less prominently, is placed a pulpit or a lectern. The message is also clear in the architecture: we gather first and foremost around the Eucharist, and the Word takes second place.<br><br>Biblical scholars suggest that this kind of division may have existed already at the time when the Gospels were written. Already then there were major variations among the different communities as to how often the Eucharist was celebrated and what its exact role was in bringing the community together. In either case, however, it was still deemed to be central, the summit to which we are called. Augustine, perhaps the most influential Christian theologian of all time, puts it this way: Jesus didn't leave us the church and from the church we derive the Eucharist; rather, for him, Jesus left us the Eucharist and from the Eucharist we derive the church. The church is in service of the Eucharist, not vice versa. Heaven will be a banquet table. The Eucharist already is that table. Because of this, Roman Catholics teach that the Eucharist is the source and the summit of all Christian life. However, because it is both source and summit, it gives a mixed message: it is both the sign of our unity and a means of coming to that unity. It is both the end to which all Christians are journeying and, at least partially, the means to get there. This double meaning has been the source of much, and sometimes bitter, debate among the churches in regard to the practice of intercommunion.<br><br>3<br><br>The RADICAL, SHOCKING, RAW, PHYSICAL CHARACTER<br><br>of the EUCHARIST<br><br>A few years ago Brenda Peterson wrote a book of essays titled Nature and Other Mothers.3 Her first entry is wonderfully named In Praise of Skin. In it, she tells how at one point in her life she was afflicted by painful skin rashes. Like the woman with the hemorrhage in the Gospels, she tried every possible doctor, but found no cure. Medication after medication proved ineffective, and eventually the doctors ran out of things to try. The rash always came back.<br><br>One day her grandmother assessed her and pronounced a more ancient and accurate diagnosis: "Skin needs to be touched!" Her grandmother then began to give her regular skin massages, and these did what the more sophisticated medicines couldn't do. They cured her.<br><br>Peterson's grandmother is right: Skin needs to be touched!<br><br>God knows that better than anyone. It's why Jesus gave us the Eucharist. In the Eucharist skin gets touched. The Eucharist isn't abstract, a theological instruction, a creed, a moral precept, a philosophy, or even just an intimate word. It's bodily, an embrace, a kiss, something shockingly physical, the real presence in a deeper way than even the old metaphysics imagined.<br><br>For whatever reasons, we tend to shy away from admitting how radically physical the Eucharist actually is. Saint Paul didn't share that fear. For him, the physical communion that takes place in the Eucharist, between us and Christ as well as among ourselves, is as real and radical as sexual union. For example, he argues against sex outside of marriage by saying that our union with Christ and each other in the Body of Christ is so intimate and real that, in effect, we would prostitute that Body if we were to have illicit sex. Strong words, but they are predicated on a very earthy conception of the Eucharist.<br><br>The early church followed Paul on this. They understood the Eucharist as so real, so physical, and so intimate that they surrounded it with the same taboos of privacy, reverence, and reticence that we reserve for sexual intimacy. For some centuries the early church had a practice (still partially followed in<br><br>some present--day church programs) that it called the Disci-plina Arcani. The discipline tried to guarantee that nobody who was not baptized or fully initiated into the community could participate in the Eucharist (beyond the liturgy of the Word). As well, Christians who were fully initiated were forbidden to speak to outsiders about the Eucharist. The intent of the discipline was not to create a mystique around the Eucharist so as to draw people to it through curiosity. Rather the idea was that the Eucharist is so intimate an act that propriety, respect, and reverence demand non--exhibitionism: you don't make love in public, and you don't talk to outsiders about this kind of intimacy.<br><br>We tend to shy away from that kind of talk. Partly that's understandable. It's hard to be comfortable religiously with how Christianity understands the physical and the bodily.<br><br>Christianity is without doubt the earthiest of all religions.4 Unlike most other religions, it doesn't call you out of the physical, out of the body, or out of the world. Rather it tells you that God enters the physical, becomes one with it, blesses it, redeems it, and that there is no reason to escape from it.<br><br>Something in that goes against the grain. Christ's relationship to the physical scandalized his contemporaries. "This is intolerable language!" is what the crowds said when Jesus spoke of the physical character of the Eucharist in John's Gospel, and the raw physical character of the Eucharist is still hard for us to accept today. But it's also a wonderful part of Christianity. In the Eucharist, our skin gets touched.<br><br>And, given our tensions and loneliness, we need that touch frequently, daily even. The late essayist and novelist Andre Dubus once wrote a wonderful little apologia on why he went to Eucharist regularly, despite the eyebrows that were sometimes raised in the circles he moved in. Here are his words:<br><br>This morning I received the sacrament I still believe in: at seven-- fifteen the priest elevated the host, then the chalice, and spoke the words of the ritual, and the bread became flesh, the wine became blood, and minutes later I placed on my tongue the taste of forgiveness and of love that affirmed, perhaps celebrated, my being alive, my being mortal. This has nothing to do with immortality, with eternity; I love the earth too much to contemplate a life apart from it, although I believe in that life. No, this has to do with mortality and the touch of flesh, and my belief in the sacrament of the Eucharist is simple: without touch, God is a monologue, an idea, a philosophy; he must touch and be touched, the tongue on flesh, and that touch is the result of the monologues, the idea, the philosophies which led to faith; but in the instant of the touch there is no place for thinking, for talking, the silent touch affirms all that, and goes deeper: it affirms the mysteries of love and mortality.5<br><br>The Eucharist is physical, real, shockingly so.<br><br>part two<br><br>The MANY DIMENSIONS<br><br>of the EUCHARIST<br><br>Christians argue a lot about the Eucharist. What does it mean? What should it be called? How often should it be celebrated? Who should be allowed to participate fully?<br><br>There are lots of views on the Eucharist. For some it is a meal, for others it is a sacrifice. For some it is a ritual act, sacred and set apart, for others it is a community gathering, the more mess and kids the better. For some it is a deep personal prayer, for others it is a communal worship for the world. For some its very essence is a coming together, a communion, of those united in a single denominational faith, while for others part of its essence is its reaching out, given that it contains an innate imperative to wash the feet of those who are different from ourselves. For some it is a celebration of sorrow, a making present of Christ's suffering, the place where we can break down, for others it is the place to celebrate joy and sing alleluia. For some it is a ritual remembrance, a bringing into the present of the historical events of Jesus' dying, rising, ascending, and sending the Holy Spirit, for others it is a celebration of God's presence with us today. For some it is a celebration of the Last Supper, something to be done less frequently, for others it is God's daily feeding of his people with a new manna, Christ's body, and is something to be done every day. For some it is a celebration of reconciliation, a ritual that forgives and unites, for others unity and reconciliation are preconditions for its proper celebration. For some it is a vigil act, a gathering that is essentially about waiting for something else or someone else to appear, for others it is a celebration of something that is already present and is asking to be received and recognized. For some it is understood to make present the real, physical body of Christ, for others it is understood to make Christ present in a real but spiritual way. Some call it the Lord's Supper, some call it the Eucharist, some call it the Mass. Some celebrate it once a year, some celebrate it four times a year, some celebrate it every Sunday, and some celebrate it every day.

He joined the Merchant Navy at the age of sixteen and spent much of his early life at sea. He was torpedoed during the Second World War and resulting spinal injuries plagued him for the rest of his life. Towards the end of the war Pope turned to journalism, becoming the Naval and Defence Correspondent for the &#39;London Evening News&#39;. At this time he also researched naval history and in time became an authority on the Napoleonic era and Nelson&#39;s exploits, resulting in several well received volumes, especially on the Battles of Copenhagen and Trafalgar. Encouraged by Hornblower creator CS Forester, he also began writing fiction using his own experiences in the Navy and his extensive historical research as a basis. In 1965, he wrote &#39;Ramage&#39;, the first of his highly successful series of novels following the exploits of the heroic &#39;Lord Nicholas Ramage&#39; during the Napoleonic Wars. Another renowned series is centred on &#39;Ned Yorke&#39;, a buccaneer in the seventeenth century Caribbean and then with a descendant following the &#39;Yorke&#39; family naval tradition when involved in realistic secret operations during the Second World War. Dudley Pope lived aboard boats whenever possible, along with his wife and daughter, and this was where he wrote the majority of his novels. Most of his adult life was spent in the Caribbean and in addition to using the locale for fictional settings he also wrote authoritatively on naval history of the region, including a biography of the buccaneer Sir Henry Morgan. He died in 1997 aged seventy one. &#39;The first and still favourite rival to Hornblower&#39; - Daily Mirror"The excitement never slackens."&nbsp; &#x2014;<i>The Sunday Times</i><br><br>"The first and still favourite rival to Hornblower."&nbsp; &#x2014;<i>Daily Mirror</i></p><h2>O&#39;Connor&#39;s Texas Civil Forms 2013</h2><p>Easy-to-use, plain-English forms for common motions and responses covered in O'Connor's Texas Rules * Civil Trials.<p>Download customizable forms you can edit in Microsoft Word or Corel WordPerfect.</p><p> Hundreds of litigation forms written in plain English and formatted for quick, efficient completion.</p><p> Get the complete court document in one form.</p><p> Customize the form to fit your case with easy-to-add statements for designating defendants, alleging jurisdiction and venue, and asserting verified pleas and affirmative defenses.</p></p><p></p><h2>Endangered (Joe Pickett)</h2><p><p>Blood is thicker than water. </p><p>Joe Pickett has good reason to dislike Dallas Cates, rodeo champion.

He was up<br>to twenty-one.<br><br>Feathers carpeted the dry soil and clung to the waxy blue-green<br>leaves of the sagebrush within a fifty-foot radius. The air smelled of<br>dust, sage, and blood.<br><br>It was late morning in mid-March on a vast brush-covered flat<br>managed by the federal Bureau of Land Management. There wasn&#x2019;t<br>a single tree for eighteen miles to the west on the BLM land until<br>the rolling hills rocked back on their heels and began their sharp<br>ascent into the snow-covered Bighorn Mountains, which were managed<br>by the U.S. Forest Service. The summits of the mountains were<br>obscured by a sudden late-season snowstorm, and the sky was leaden<br>and close. Joe&#x2019;s green Game and Fish Ford pickup straddled the ancient<br>two-track road that had brought him up there, the engine<br>idling and the front driver&#x2019;s door still open from when he&#x2019;d leapt<br>out. His yellow Labrador, Daisy, was trembling in the bed of the<br>truck, her front paws poised on the top of the bed wall as she stared<br>out at the expanse of land. Twin strings of drool hung from her<br>mouth. She smelled the carnage out on the flat, and she wanted to<br>be a part of it.<br><br>&#x201c;Stay,&#x201d; Joe commanded.<br><br>Daisy moaned, reset her paws, and trembled some more.<br><br>Joe wore his red uniform shirt with the pronghorn patch on the<br>sleeve, Wrangler jeans, cowboy boots, and a Filson vest against the<br>chill. His worn gray Stetson was clamped on tight. A rarely drawn .40<br>Glock semiauto was on his hip.<br><br>Twenty-one dead sage grouse.<br><br>In his youth, everyone called them &#x201c;prairie chickens,&#x201d; and he<br>knew the young ones were good to eat when roasted because they&#x2019;d<br>been a staple in his poverty-filled college days. They were odd birds:<br>chicken-sized, pear-shaped, ungainly when flying. They were the<br>largest of the grouse species, and their habitat once included most<br>of the western United States and Canada. Wyoming contained one<br>hundred thousand of them, forty percent of the North American<br>population.<br><br>Of this flock, he&#x2019;d noted only three survivors: all three with injuries.<br>He&#x2019;d seen their teardrop-shaped forms ghosting from brush to<br>brush on the periphery of the location. They didn&#x2019;t fly away, he<br>knew, because they couldn&#x2019;t yet.<br><br>It was obvious what had happened.<br><br>Fat tire tracks churned through the sagebrush, crushing some<br>plants and snapping others at their woody stalks. Spent 12-gauge<br>shotgun shells littered the ground: Federal four-shot. He speared<br>one through its open end with his pen and sniffed. It still smelled of<br>gunpowder. He retrieved eighteen spent shells and bagged them.<br>Later, after he&#x2019;d sealed the evidence bag, he found two more shells.<br>Since eighteen shells were more than a representative sample, he<br>tossed the two errant casings into the back of his pickup.<br><br>There was a single empty Coors Light can on the northeast corner<br>of the site. He bagged it and tagged it, and hoped the forensics lab in<br>Laramie could pull prints from the outside or DNA from the lip.<br>Problem was, the can looked much older than the spent shotgun<br>shells and he couldn&#x2019;t determine if it hadn&#x2019;t simply been discarded<br>along the road a few weeks prior to the slaughter.<br><br>Joe guessed that the incident had occurred either the night or<br>day before, because the exploded carcasses hadn&#x2019;t yet been picked<br>over by predators. Small spoors of blood in the dirt had not yet dried<br>black. Whoever had done it had shot them &#x201c;on the lek,&#x201d; a lek being<br>an annual gathering of the birds where the males strutted and<br>clucked to attract females for breeding. The lek was a concentric<br>circle of birds with the strutting male grouse in the center of it. Some<br>leks were so large and predictable that locals would drive out to the<br>location to watch the avian meat market in action.<br><br>The birds bred in mid-March, nested, and produced chicks in<br>June. If someone was to choose the most opportune time to slaughter<br>an entire flock, this was it, Joe knew.<br><br>So &#x201c;Lek 64,&#x201d; as it had been designated by a multiagency team of<br>biologists charged with counting the number of healthy groupings<br>within the state, was no more.<br><br>Joe took a deep breath and put his hands on his hips. He was<br>angry, and he worked his jaw. It would take hours to photograph the<br>carcasses and measure and photograph the tire tracks. He knew he&#x2019;d<br>have to do it himself because the county forensics tech was an hour<br>away&#x2014;provided the tech was on call and would even respond to a<br>game violation. Joe knew he was responsible for the gathering of all<br>evidence to send to the state lab in Laramie, and it would have to get<br>done before the snow that was falling on top of the mountains<br>worked its way east and obscured the evidence. Since it was Friday<br>and the lab technicians didn&#x2019;t work over the weekend, at best he&#x2019;d<br>hear something by the end of next week.<br><br>He&#x2019;d find whoever did this, he thought. It might take time, but<br>he&#x2019;d find the shooter or shooters. Fingerprints on the brass of the<br>shells, tire analysis, the beer can, gossipy neighbors, or a drunken<br>boast would lead him to the bad guys. Sometimes it was ridiculously<br>easy to solve these kinds of crimes because the kind of person who<br>would leave such a naked scene often wasn&#x2019;t very smart. Joe had<br>apprehended poachers in the past by finding photos of them posing<br>with dead game on Facebook posts or by looking at the taxidermy<br>mounts in their homes. Or by simply going to their front door,<br>knocking, and saying, &#x201c;I guess you know why I&#x2019;m here.&#x201d;<br><br>It had been amazing what kinds of answers that inquiry sometimes<br>brought.<br><br>But he wasn&#x2019;t angry because of the work ahead of him. There was<br>also that special directive recently put out by Governor Rulon and<br>his agency director about sage grouse. Preserving them, that is.<br>Game and Fish biologists and wardens had been ordered to pay special<br>attention to where the grouse were located and how many there<br>were. The status of the sage grouse population, according to Rulon,<br>was &#x201c;pivotal&#x201d; to the future economic well-being of the state.<br><br>Sage grouse in Wyoming had shifted from the status of a game<br>bird regulated by the state into politics and economics on a national<br>level. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was threatening to list the<br>bird as an endangered species because the overall population had<br>declined, and if they did, it would remove hundreds of thousands of<br>acres from any kind of use, including energy development&#x2014;whether<br>gas and oil, wind, hydrothermal, or solar. The federal government<br>proposed mandating an off-limits zone consisting of one to four<br>miles for every lek found. That would impact ranchers, developers,<br>and everyone else.<br><br>That was the reason Joe had been on the old two-track in the first<br>place and stumbled onto the killing ground. During the winter, he&#x2019;d<br>seen the flock more than once from the window of his pickup, and<br>sage grouse didn&#x2019;t range far. Sage grouse did not exhibit the brightest<br>of bird behavior. He recalled an incident from the year before,<br>when a big male&#x2014;called a &#x201c;bomber&#x201d; by hunters&#x2014;flew into the passenger<br>door of his pickup and bounced off, killing itself in the<br>process. Joe&#x2019;s truck hadn&#x2019;t been moving at the time.<br><br>Years before, prior to the national decline in the sage grouse population,<br>Joe had accompanied outlaw falconer Nate Romanowski to<br>this very sagebrush bench. At the time, Nate flew a prairie falcon<br>and a red-tailed hawk. Joe and Nate served as bird dogs, walking<br>through the brush to dislodge the grouse while the raptors hunted<br>from the air. Grouse defended themselves against the falcons by<br>flopping over onto their backs and windmilling their sharp claws,<br>but the raptors got them anyway, in an explosion of feathers.<br><br>Joe wondered if he&#x2019;d ever hunt with Nate again, and not just because<br>of the sage grouse problem. With a half-dozen serious allegations<br>hanging over his head by the feds, Nate had agreed to turn<br>state&#x2019;s witness against his former employer, a high-society killer for<br>hire. Nate had not touched base with Joe, or Marybeth, or their<br>daughter Sheridan in months. Joe had no idea if Nate&#x2019;s long-ago<br>pledge to protect the Pickett family still held. And Joe was still angry<br>with him for getting mixed up in a murder-for-hire operation, even<br>if the targets richly deserved killing.<br><br>Joe shook his head to clear it, and looked at the carnage. Half<br>a year after being named &#x201c;Special Liaison to the Executive Branch&#x201d;<br>by Rulon himself, in the middle of Joe&#x2019;s own five-thousand-squaremile<br>district, he&#x2019;d discovered the site of the wanton destruction of<br>twenty-one rare game birds whose deaths could bring down the state<br>of Wyoming.<br><br>That&#x2019;s when the call came. And suddenly he was no longer thinking<br>about birds.<br><br>The display said mike reed.<br><br>Reed was sheriff of Twelve Sleep County, and had been for two<br>years. He was a personal friend of Joe&#x2019;s and had cleaned up the department,<br>ridding it of the old cronies and flunkies who had been<br>collected by the previous chief, Kyle McLanahan. Reed was a paraplegic<br>due to gunshot wounds he&#x2019;d received in the line of duty and<br>he traveled in a specially outfitted van. His injuries had never prevented<br>him from getting around or performing his job.<br><br>Reed&#x2019;s voice was tense. Joe could hear the sound of a motor in<br>the background. He was speeding somewhere in his van.<br><br>Reed said, &#x201c;Joe, we&#x2019;ve got a situation. Are you in a place where<br>you can sit down?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, but go ahead.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m running out to meet my deputy on Dunbar Road. He responded<br>to a call from a couple of hunters this morning. They<br>claimed they found a victim in a ditch.&#x201d;<br><br>Joe knew Dunbar Road. It was south of Saddlestring, an obscure<br>county road that ended up at a couple of old reservoirs in the break-<br>lands. It was a road to nowhere, really, used only by hunters, anglers,<br>and people who were lost.<br><br>&#x201c;The victim is a young woman, Joe,&#x201d; Reed said. &#x201c;She was found<br>by Deputy Boner.&#x201d;<br><br>Joe felt himself squeezing his cell phone as if to kill it.<br><br>&#x201c;My deputy thinks she looks a lot like April. He says he knew<br>April from when she worked at Welton&#x2019;s Western Wear, and it might<br>be her.&#x201d;<br><br>Joe&#x2019;s knees weakened, and he took a step back. April was their<br>eighteen-year-old adopted daughter. She&#x2019;d disappeared the previous<br>November with a professional rodeo cowboy and they&#x2019;d only heard<br>from her two or three times. Each time she called, she said not to<br>worry about her. She was, she said, &#x201c;having the time of her life.&#x201d;<br><br>Because she&#x2019;d turned eighteen, there was little Joe or Marybeth<br>could do, except encourage her to come home.<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s alive?&#x201d; Joe asked, his mouth dry.<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe. Barely. We&#x2019;re not sure. It might not be her, Joe. There&#x2019;s<br>no ID on her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where is she now?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In the backseat of my deputy&#x2019;s cruiser,&#x201d; Reed said. &#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t<br>want to wait for the EMTs to get out there. He said it looks touch<br>and go whether she&#x2019;ll even make it as far as the hospital.&#x201d;<br><br>Joe took a quivering breath. The storm cloud was moving down<br>the face of the mountains, the snow blotting out the blue-black<br>forest of pine trees.<br><br>&#x201c;Whether it&#x2019;s April or not,&#x201d; Reed said, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s a terrible thing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mike, was she in an accident?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t sound like it,&#x201d; Reed said. &#x201c;There was no vehicle around.<br>It looks like she was dumped there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dumped?&#x201d; Joe asked. &#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t she walk toward town?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s been beaten,&#x201d; Reed said. &#x201c;Man, I hate to be the one telling<br>you this. But my guy says it looks like she was beaten to a pulp and<br>dumped. Whoever did it might have thought she was already dead.<br>Obviously, I don&#x2019;t know the extent of her injuries, how long she&#x2019;s<br>been there, or if there was, you know, a sexual assault.&#x201d;<br><br>Joe leaned against the front fender of his pickup. He couldn&#x2019;t recall<br>walking back to his truck, but there he was. The phone was<br>pressed so tightly against his face, it hurt.<br><br>March and April were usually the snowiest months in high-country<br>Wyoming, when huge dumps of spring snow arrived between short<br>bursts of false spring. The last week had been unseasonably warm, so<br>he was grateful she hadn&#x2019;t died of exposure.<br><br>Joe said, &#x201c;So you&#x2019;re going to meet your deputy and escort him to<br>the hospital?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Roger that,&#x201d; Reed said. &#x201c;How quick can you get there? I&#x2019;m<br>about to scramble Life Flight and get them down here so they can<br>transport her to the trauma center in Billings. These injuries are<br>beyond what our clinic can handle. Can you get there and . . .<br>identify her?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m twenty miles out on bad roads, but yes, I&#x2019;ll be there,&#x201d; Joe<br>said, motioning for Daisy to leap down from the bed of the truck<br>and take her usual spot on the passenger seat. He followed her in<br>and slammed the door. &#x201c;Does Marybeth know?&#x201d;<br><br>Marybeth was now the director of the Twelve Sleep County Library.<br>She&#x2019;d be at the building until five-thirty p.m., but she was<br>known to monitor the police band.<br><br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t told her,&#x201d; Reed said, &#x201c;and I asked my guys to keep a lid<br>on this until I reached you. I thought maybe you&#x2019;d want to tell her.&#x201d;<br><br>Joe engaged the transmission and roared down the old two-track.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call her,&#x201d; Joe said, raising his voice because the road was<br>rough and the cab was rattling with vibration. Citation books, maps,<br>and assorted paperwork fluttered down through the cab from where<br>they had been parked beneath the sun visors. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll meet you there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Joe,&#x201d; Reed said with pain in his voice. &#x201c;But keep in<br>mind we don&#x2019;t know for sure it&#x2019;s her.&#x201d;<br><br>Joe said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s her,&#x201d; and punched off.<br><br>He called Marybeth&#x2019;s cell phone. When she answered, he<br>slowed down enough so that he could hear her.<br><br>&#x201c;Mike Reed just told me they&#x2019;re transporting a female victim to<br>the hospital,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;She was found dumped south of town. Mike<br>says there&#x2019;s a possibility the girl could be&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;April,&#x201d; Marybeth said, finishing the sentence for him. &#x201c;How bad<br>is she?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Bad,&#x201d; Joe said, and he told her about the Life Flight helicopter en<br>route to the hospital from Billings.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll meet you there,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>Before he could agree, she said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve had nightmares about this<br>for months. Ever since she left with that cowboy.&#x201d; Joe thought, She<br>can&#x2019;t even say his name.<br><br>Joe disconnected the call, dropped his phone into his breast<br>pocket, and jammed down on the accelerator. Twin plumes of dust<br>from his back tires filled the rearview mirror.<br><br>&#x201c;Hang on,&#x201d; he said to Daisy.<br><br>Then: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to kill Dallas Cates.&#x201d;<br><br>Daisy looked back as if to say We&#x2019;ll kill him together.<br>2<br>After what seemed like the longest forty-five minutes of his life,<br>Joe arrived at the Twelve Sleep County Hospital and found<br>Marybeth in the emergency entrance lobby. Sheriff Mike<br>Reed was with her, as was Deputy Edgar Jess Boner, who had found<br>the victim and transported her into town.<br><br>Marybeth was calm and in control, but her face was drained of<br>color.

Sporting a new identity, she takes up with a gang of squatters who live in the city's labyrinthine subway system. <br> But there's something eerily beguiling about Val's new friends. Impulsive Lolli talks of monsters in the subway tunnels they call home and shoots up a shimmery amber-colored powder that makes the shadows around her dance. Severe Luis claims he can make deals with creatures that no one else can see. And then there's Luis's brother, timid and sensitive Dave, who makes the mistake of letting Val tag along as he makes a delivery to a woman who turns out to have goat hooves instead of feet. <br> When a bewildered Val allows Lolli to talk her into tracking down the hidden lair of the creature for whom Luis and Dave have been dealing, Val finds herself bound into service by a troll named Ravus. He is as hideous as he is honorable. And as Val grows to know him, she finds herself torn between her affection for an honorable monster and her fear of what her new friends are becoming. <br> Bestselling author Holly Black follows her breakout debut, <i>Tithe,</i> with a rich, harrowing, and compulsively readable parable of betrayal, abuse, friendship, and love.</p><p>Holly Black is the author of bestselling contemporary fantasy books for kids and teens.

Her living situation is utterly safe compared to her entanglements in the mysterious murders of faeries and her involvement in a burgeoning romance with a fey healer who considers himself a monster. Renee Raudman gives a laudable performance on many counts. Her vocal variations go beyond differentiating gender to make aural distinctions between supernatural and human characters. Raudman's huskiness enhances the darkness and mystery that permeate the story. Her even pacing, clarity, and character distinctions are crucial to help listeners navigate the complexity of the murders and fey politics.

He was, of course, as this book beautifully displays, one of this country's finest artists. Beginning as a Colonial primitive, Stuart limited himself to portrait painting, and achieved international fame before his death in 1828. McLanathan ably presents a clear, intelligent biography that is profusely illustrated with 51 color reproductions and 50 black-and-whites. This brief treatment of Stuart's life is not meant to compete with the only major biography to date, Charles Merrill Mount's Gilbert Stuart, a Biography (Norton, 1964).

In a Europe-flavored fantasy world, King Henry of Wendar is beset by two powerful enemies: the invading nonhuman Eika and their huge, terrible dogs; and by his half-sister Sabella of Varre, who denies Henry's right to name as his heir his bastard son Sanglant. Young, parentless Alain, seemingly destined for the church, is granted a vision of the Lady of Battles and eventually attaches himself to Count Lavastine--who also keeps large, vicious dogs that, other than the Count himself, only Alain can control. At this point, however, Lavastine, a neutral in the struggle for power, is ensorcelled by Sabella's allies and marches to war against Henry. Meanwhile, Liath, having spent most of her young life with her beloved Da fleeing unknown enemies, is enslaved by churchman Hugh when Da is murdered, leaving Liath unable to pay his debuts. Hugh hopes to grab the book of magic that Da left Liath, but just in time she's recruited by Wolfhere of the King's Eagles. Wolfhere knew Da and suspects Liath has magic abilities; both Alain and Liath will play important parts in the showdown between Sabella and Henry. A creditably self-contained and appealing, modestly engrossing opener, though without much originality or bite. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Steven Bouma-Prediger brings ecotheology into conversation with the emerging field of environmental virtue ethics, exploring the character traits and virtues required for Christians to be responsible keepers of the earth and to flourish in the challenging decades to come. He shows how virtue ethics can enrich Christian environmentalism, helping readers think and act in ways that rightly value creation.</p><p><b>"Philosophically astute, ecologically attuned, and biblically profound"<br></b><br>"'What we do depends on who we are' is the thoughtful theme of this wonderfully refreshing book with an illuminating biblical focus on earthkeeping. Inviting us to the pulsing heart of caring for, serving, and keeping the entire biosphere, Bouma-Prediger helps us reframe our ecological ethics by centering on the virtues of wonder and humility, self-control and wisdom, justice and love, and courage and hope. He thus invites us to develop and nurture personal character to make earthkeeping integral to Christian faith."<br>--<b>Calvin&nbsp;B.

Original. 125,000 first printing.</p><p>The Boston Women's Health Book Collective (now known as Our Bodies Ourselves) is a non-profit organization founded in 1969 whose board members include Teresa Heinz Kerry, Susan Love, and Gloria Steinem. Their mission is to empower women by providing information about health, sexuality, and reproduction. <i>Our Bodies, Ourselves</i> is the organization's core vehicle for driving their mission. While OBOS is famous for its voice in policy, advocacy, and educational efforts related to women's health, they see their role as a global content provider as paramount. Judy Norsigian is the Executive Director of Our Bodies Ourselves.<p></p><p><b><b>INTRODUCTION </b></b></p><p>We are delighted to present <i>Our Bodies, Ourselves</i>&#x2014;an in-depth look at women&#x2019;s sexuality and reproductive health, from the first gynecological exam to sexual health in our later years.</p><p>Since its first newsprint edition published in the early 1970s, <i>Our Bodies, Ourselves</i> (<i>OBOS</i>) has enabled women to learn about their bodies, gain insight from the experiences of other women, and consider how best to achieve political and cultural changes that would improve women&#x2019;s lives. This completely revised and updated ninth edition, released on <i>OBOS</i>&#x2019;s fortieth anniversary, covers topics ranging from sexual anatomy, body image, and gender identity to pregnancy and birth, perimenopause/menopause, and navigating the health-care system.</p><p>This edition reflects the perspective and voices of a wide range of women, and their stories are told through new formats. At our invitation, more than three dozen women of all ages and identities participated in a monthlong online conversation about sexuality and relationships; we found their honesty and forthrightness so compelling that the conversation itself became the foundation of a new &#x201c;Relationships&#x201d; chapter.</p><p>Other new voices include women&#x2019;s organizations around the world that have created their own resources adapted from <i>Our Bodies, Ourselves</i>. Throughout the book, you will meet members of the Our Bodies Ourselves Global Network and read about their work on issues such as abortion, infertility, HIV education and prevention, and social activism. From distributing posters via canoes in rural Nigeria to setting up interactive websites in Israel and Turkey and reshaping health policy in Nepal and Armenia, their efforts exemplify movement building and the power of voices raised in action.</p><p>This edition focuses on the core health issues&#x2014;reproductive health and sexuality&#x2014;that first brought the Boston Women&#x2019;s Health Book Collective together. Some topics added over the years&#x2014;such as nutrition, emotional health, and medical conditions that disproportionately or differently affect women&#x2014;have been omitted this time, in part because information is now more readily available elsewhere. This has given us room to expand on issues such as reproductive rights, violence against women, and environmental health, which not only are centrally related to women&#x2019;s sexual health and well-being but also are areas where, despite decades of advocacy and activism, women still face enormous challenges and obstacles that prevent them from leading safe and healthy lives.</p><p><i>Our Bodies, Ourselves</i> is both a text dedicated to factual information grounded in the best available evidence and a resource about health-care inequities and the work of those dedicated to ending social injustices. The many contributors to this book did not always agree on how to analyze the social, economic, and political forces that affect women&#x2019;s health or how to characterize a medical controversy. When a conclusion remains uncertain, we have shared their questions and concerns so readers can make their own decisions in the absence of the kind of evidence we ultimately hope will be available. Our website (ourbodiesourselves.org) contains additional content, references, and useful links on women&#x2019;s health topics not covered in this book.</p><table><tbody><tr>Note</tr><tr><td><p>OUR BODIES OURSELVES GLOBAL INITIATIVE</p><p>Ever since Our Bodies, Ourselves became a best seller in the United States, it has inspired women in other countries to adapt it&#x2014;in part or as a whole&#x2014;to their unique cultural needs. Through the our Bodies ourselves Global Initiative, we support more than twenty-two women&#x2019;s organizations as they develop materials based on Our Bodies, Ourselves and use their resources in wide-scale outreach to advance the health and human rights of women and girls in their countries. Although the earliest projects were located primarily in Europe, we have since collaborated with organizations across Africa, South and Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Latin America, and Europe to bring culturally meaningful and reliable information to communities where it is most needed. As a result of our partnerships, resources based on the book are now available in more than twenty-five languages and in print, digital, and other socially interactive formats. You will read about our partners in the &#x201c;In Translation&#x201d; sidebars and we invite you to visit ourbodiesourselves.org/programs/network to learn more.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>As always, we recognize how the personal is often political and thus underscore when individual solutions are not possible or not lasting. Throughout the book, women who have joined with others to bring about change share their stories. The combination of practical information with political critique and women&#x2019;s lived experiences has long been the hallmark of <i>Our Bodies, Ourselves</i> and is one of the reasons the book has remained one of the most enduring legacies of the women&#x2019;s movements that grew out of the late 1960s and early 1970s.</p><p>Much has changed in the United States since the first edition, when abortion was illegal, birth control was not widely available, and the few available texts on women&#x2019;s health and sexuality&#x2014;almost all written by men&#x2014;discounted women&#x2019;s experiences and perspectives. Today, information is abundant, but it is still difficult to find reliable information that encompasses the diversity of women&#x2019;s experiences and teases apart the conflicts of interest inherent in many issues that affect women&#x2019;s health. Far too often, corporate and pharmaceutical interests influence medical research, information, and care, and contribute to the unnecessary medicalization of women&#x2019;s bodies and lives. This not only wastes money and poses avoidable risks but also can discourage women from questioning the assumptions underlying the care they receive and from valuing and sharing their own insights and experiences. The need for a book like <i>Our Bodies, Ourselves</i> remains as strong as ever.</p><p>Changing the medical system, organizing for better care, and altering the larger social, political, and economic forces that limit women&#x2019;s lives require creative and concerted efforts over a long period of time. We believe that enhancing reproductive health and sexual pleasure can play a significant positive role in all our lives and strengthen us as we work toward sustaining a vision of a world that will better nurture all women, men, and children. We encourage you to explore this book with curiosity and vision.</p><p><i>OBOS Editorial Team: Kiki Zeldes, Christine Cupaiuolo, Wendy Sanford, Judy Norsigian, Amy Romano, June Tsang, and Ayesha Chatterjee Spring 2011</i> </p><p>� 2011 the Boston Women&#x2019;s Health Book Collective</p><p></p></p><h2>Charlie Chaplin: My Autobiography</h2><p>The author recounts his difficult childhood, his career as a film comedian and director, and the controversies that surrounded his personal life</p><p>12 1.5-hour cassettes<b>SIR CHARLES SPENCER &#x201c;CHARLIE&#x201d; CHAPLIN</b> was born in 1889 in London to impoverished parents. He began performing at age ten as a member of a juvenile clog-dance troupe. In 1913, while he was touring with a vaudeville act in the US, Keystone films recruited Chaplin to make films. In only his second short&#x2014;<i>Kid Auto Races at Venice</i>&#x2014;he debuted his &#x201c;Little Tramp&#x201d; character, and his fame quickly exploded. He went on to write, direct, and star in some of the most critically acclaimed movies ever made, including the classics <i>The Gold Rush, City Lights, The Great Dictator</i>, <i>Monsieur Verdoux</i>, and <i>Modern Times</i>&#x2014;for which he also wrote the song &#x201c;Smile,&#x201d; still a standard. In 1919 he founded the United Artists film studio along with Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, and D.W. Griffith, and in 1929, the first year of the Academy Awards, he won an award for &#x201c;versatility and genius&#x201d; in <i>The Circus</i>. But Chaplin&#x2019;s career took a dark turn during the McCarthy era, when he was accused of &#x201c;un-American activities&#x201d; and monitored by the FBI; he would later satirize the McCarthy committee in his <i>A King in New York</i>, but when he visited the UK in 1952 his re-entry permit to the US was revoked. Objecting to what he described as &#x201c;lies and propaganda by powerful reactionary groups&#x201d;, he moved with his family to Switzerland, where he would live until his death on Christmas day 1977. <br><br> <b>DAVID ROBINSON </b>is a film critic and author and a biographer of Charlie Chaplin.

How did atoms assemble here on earth, and perhaps on other worlds into living beings intricate enough to ponder their origins? What fundamental laws govern our universe?This book describes new discoveries and offers remarkable insights into these fundamental questions. There are deep connections between stars and atoms, between the cosmos and the microworld. Just six numbers, imprinted in the big bang,&#x201d; determine the essential features of our entire physical world. Moreover, cosmic evolution is astonishingly sensitive to the values of these numbers. If any one of them were untuned,&#x201d; there could be no stars and no life. This realization offers a radically new perspective on our universe, our place in it, and the nature of physical laws.</p><p>Just six numbers govern the shape, size, and texture of our universe. If their values were only fractionally different, we would not exist: nor, in many cases, would matter have had a chance to form. If the numbers that govern our universe were elegant--1, say, or pi, or the Golden Mean--we would simply shrug and say that the universe was an elegant mathematical puzzle. But the numbers Martin Rees discusses are far from tidy. Was the universe "tweaked" or is it one of many universes, all run by slightly different, but equally messy, rules?<p> This is familiar ground, though rarely so comprehensively explored. What makes Rees's book exceptional is his conviction that cosmology is as materialistic and as conceptually simple as any of the earth sciences. Indeed, </p><blockquote>cosmology is simpler in one important respect: once the starting point is specified, the outcome is in broad terms predictable. All large patches of the universe that start off the same way end up statistically similar. In contrast, if the Earth's history were re-run, it could end up with a quite different biosphere.</blockquote><p> Rees demonstrates how the cosmos is full of "fossils" from which we can deduce how our universe developed as surely as we infer the earth's past from the relics found in sedimentary rocks. Rees's theme is nothing less than the colossal richness of the universe. It is an ambitious book, but if anything, it deserves to be longer. <i>--Simon Ings, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>Martin Rees is Britain&#39;s Astronomer Royal. He is the author of several books, including Gravity&#39;s Fatal Attraction: Black Holes in the Universe (with Mitchell Begelman) and Before the Beginning: Our Universe and Others. A member of the Royal Society, the United States National Academy of Sciences, the Russian Academy of Sciences, and numerous foreign academies, Rees is Royal Society Research Professor at Cambridge University.</p><h2>The Landmark Arrian: The Campaigns of Alexander</h2><p>The Landmark Arrian is an important new edition of The Campaigns of Alexander, the most authoritative ancient account of one of the world&#x2019;s most brilliant military leaders. During twelve years of continuous campaigns, Alexander conquered an empire that stretched from the shores of the Adriatic to the edge of modern India. Arrian&#x2019;s history of those conquests, the most reliable and detailed account to emerge from the ancient world, is a work that will fascinate readers interested in classical studies, the history of warfare, and the origins of East-West tensions that still simmer today in Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan. Drawing on Ptolemy&#x2019;s memoirs and other sources that have not survived antiquity, Arrian&#x2019;s portrait of Alexander is unmatched for its accuracy and immediacy. Having served as a high Roman official with command of an army, Arrian had a unique perspective on Alexander, imbued with a level of understanding that only firsthand military experience can provide.

He lives in Brookline, Massachusetts.</p>Anabasis Alexandrou (The Campaigns of Alexander), by Lucius Flavius Arrianus, a Roman of the second century, is the principal literary source for modern accounts about the Macedonian conqueror. If its composition three centuries after Alexander the Great lived inherently raises scholarly questions, Arrian&#x2019;s account possesses a narrative momentum that will always interest general readers of ancient Greek history. To that audience, the editors have directed their Landmark series, which counts Herodotus, Thucydides, and Xenophon in its prior lineage. Its formula of maps, photographs, chronologies, footnotes, and appendixes exceptionally elucidates texts without impeding their flow; readers may digress into academic controversies or forge ahead to the next battle, according to their wont. Arrian satisfies the latter inclination: historians use his information to reconstruct Alexander&#x2019;s battlefield tactics, which this volume&#x2019;s charts graphically depict. Arrian&#x2019;s Roman audience harbored additional curiosities about Alexander, such as omens of his divinity, purges of his retinue, or incidents damaging to his reputation such as the destruction of the Persian capital Persepolis. A dual-use technology, the Landmark package is ideal for library needs: students may study, and browsers may browse. --Gilbert Taylor</p><h2>Bruce Lee&#39;s Fighting Method, Vol. 1 (1)</h2><p>Long before mixed martial arts became a worldwide phenomenon and Ultimate Fighting became a household name, Bruce Lee created jeet kune do, a realistic combat hybrid that incorporated the most useful elements of kung fu, boxing, and fencing. Here the legendary fighter demonstrates the most effective methods for retaliating against surprise attacks, grabs, chokes, multiple attackers, and armed assailants. Because Lee believed that the best defence is the most simple and effective, his no-nonsense counters include eye gouges, groin kicks, head stomps, and other techniques that aren&#39;t taught in most studios.This first volume in &#34;Bruce Lee&#39;s Fighting Method&#34; contains detailed illustrations and vintage photos capturing Lee in his prime. The essential series, compiled and organized by his close friend, Mito Uyehara, is the perfect companion to Bruce Lee&#39;s classic text, &#34;Tao of Jeet Kune Do&#34;. &#34;The Bruce Lee&#39;s Fighting Method&#34; series is an integral part of the Bruce Lee canon and a necessary addition for collectors and martial arts enthusiasts alike.</p><p><p><b>Bruce Lee</b> flashed like a meteor through the world of martial arts and motion pictures.

Because of his intense training and study, he was eventually able to refine, distill and mature into a philosopher, technician and innovator of the martial arts.</p><br> <p>After intensively studying various martial arts styles and theories, Lee developed a concept that he later called <i>jeet kune do</i>, the way of the intercepting fist. Jeet kune do was born not only out of his physical training and personal research--his martial arts library contained more than 2,000 books--but his formal education as a philosophy major at the University of Washington, Seattle, as well.</p> <br> <p>Lee also combined his martial arts expertise with the acting skills he developed as a child in Hong Kong, starring in several motion pictures: <i>The Big Boss, Fists of Fury, Way of the Dragon and Enter the Dragon</i>.</p><br> <p>A longtime aikido practitioner, <b>Mito Uyehara</b> founded <i>Black Belt</i> magazine in 1961 and served as the owner for more than 30 years.

As a wonderfully talented designer and artistic entrepreneur, Morris created a style that still lives; as a contradictory political figure - at once a radical and a traditionalist - he was a founding father of British Socialism in the era of Marx and Engels; as a poet and storyteller, he attained a huge contemporary reputation, producing several best-sellers; and as the husband of the Pre-Raphaelite icon Jane Morris (whose love affair with Dante Gabriel Rossetti caused a stir and led to many famous paintings), he was the subject of personal torments as profound as his creative ones.<br>In this biography, Fiona MacCarthy brings all the strands together, from the dreamy boy in a London suburb spinning medieval fantasies to the great bearded patriarch dividing his time between the design and production of beautiful fabrics, the translation of Icelandic epics, and the promotion of Socialism on street corners. Her understanding of his work as an artist-craftsman is profound, yet she is equally illuminating about the strange mixture of nostalgia and yearning for change that shaped his politics. At the same time, she is prepared to deal frankly and in detail with his often painful personal life.</p><p>Fiona MacCarthy established herself as one of the leading writers of biography in Britain with her widely acclaimed book Eric Gill, published in 1989. Byron: Life and Legend was described by A. N. Wilson as &#39;a flawless triumph&#39; and William Morris, described by A. S. Byatt as &#39;large, delicious and intelligent, full of shining detail&#39;, won the Wolfson History Prize and the Writers&#39; Guild Non-Fiction Award. Fiona MacCarthy received the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for biography for The Last Pre-Raphaelite, and was awarded the OBE for services to literature in 2009.An accomplished and original designer of textiles and furniture, books and typefaces, a socialist activist, poet and novelist (News from Nowhere), Morris (1834- 1896) had a "magpie mind" that sought expression in any number of media. MacCarthy (Eric Gill, a prize-winning biography of the sculptor), illuminates the paradoxes that shaped Morris's "painfully heroic progress through life." Morris was a manufacturer of lush housewares who rejected his father as a "capitalist villain"; an astringent critic of Victorian England who nearly became its poet laureate; a man both worldly and naive, stymied by his wife's affair with the charismatic Pre-Raphaelite artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Morris emerges in vivid snapshots as vital, protean and compassionate. This is the biography of a temperament?of a burgeoning reaction against late Victorian bourgeois complacency?that Morris shared with his friend painter Edward Burne-Jones, Rossetti, George Bernard Shaw and others. It also is shaped by interesting extended discussions?of the period's architecture, politics and literature?that sometimes distract from the account of the life they purportedly illuminate. Erudite, lavishly illustrated, including 24 pages of color, and absorbing, this is of interest for the amateur as well as the professional student of Victorian England. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Visual Encyclopedia of Ships</h2><p>From the dawn of civilization, man has held a fascination with the sea and over the centuries has built myriad ships and sailing craft for an equally diverse range of purposes.

Then, in September 1838, a young Englishman named Charles Darwin hit upon the idea that "natural selection" among competing individuals would lead to wondrous adaptations and species diversity. Twenty-one years passed between that epiphany and publication of <i>On the Origin of Species</i>. The human drama and scientific basis of Darwin's twenty-one-year delay constitute a fascinating, tangled tale that elucidates the character of a cautious naturalist who initiated an intellectual revolution.<br><br><i>The Reluctant Mr. Darwin</i> is a book for everyone who has ever wondered about who this man was and what he said. Drawing from Darwin's secret "transmutation" notebooks and his personal letters, David Quammen has sketched a vivid life portrait of the man whose work never ceases to be controversial.</p><p><b>David Quammen</b>, the author of <i>The Song of the Dodo</i>, is a three-time winner of the National Magazine Award, most recently for a <i>National Geographic</i> story on Darwin. He lives in Bozeman, Montana.Why did Charles Darwin, hitting upon the idea of natural selection in 1838, wait 21 years to present his startling discovery? Was he shy? Was the idea not ready for public scrutiny? Or was he himself spiritually troubled by it? Quammen, understandably perplexed by this caution, examines the great man's life, following the growth of his ideas to hypothesize why he delayed publication. Grover Gardner's reading pulses with the excitement of Quammen's quest. As the author sifts through Darwin's developing insights and personality quirks, including anxiety and compulsive vomiting, Gardner is perfectly alert to the author's subtle irony and humor, which Quammen could hardly avoid. Portraying Darwin respectfully and fully aware of his stature, Quammen never loses sight of the Victorian roots that troubled Darwin all his life. P.E.F.

Bailey examines this canonical letter through the lenses of Paul&#39;s Jewish socio-cultural and rhetorical background and the Mediterranean context of the Corinthian recipients. In a set of connected essays, he draws the reader&#39;s attention to the letter&#39;s rootedness in the Hebrew prophetic tradition, the intentional theological structure of Paul&#39;s epistolary organization and the Near Eastern cultural practices that inflect Paul&#39;s rhetorical performance. All of this is brought to bear in teasing out the nature of Paul&#39;s response to the critical situations facing the Corinthian community: racial, ethnic and theological divisions, sexual misconduct, intimate interaction with pagan practices and disputes about church practices.</p><p>Kenneth E. Bailey is an author and lecturer in Middle Eastern New Testament studies. An ordained Presbyterian minister, he also serves as Canon Theologian of the Diocese of Pittsburgh of the Episcopal Church, USA.

During that time, she kept diaries and journals and wrote a body of devotional literature. As a gifted artist, she painted and sketched beautiful watercolors and drawings along with her personal and published writings. These images and writings document the inner as well as the outward events of her life. Francis Bacon wrote: &#34;God has two textbooks-Scripture and Creation-we would do well to listen to both. Lilias listened to and observed both, leaving to us this rich legacy of faith in her art and writings.</p><p><p>In 1888, Lilias Trotter, daughter of a distinguished Victorian family, left her comfortable upper-class lifestyle in London to venture into the Arab world of Algeria and Northern Africa, where she spent the rest of her life living out the life and light and love of Jesus Christ to those around her. Lilias viewed the world with "heartsight as deep as eyesight", and her artistic talent took both visual and verbal form as she documented in words and sketches the seasons of her forty years in Algeria.</p><p>The exquisite paintings and deeply inspirational writings in <i>A Blossom in the Desert</i> are drawn from the extensive body of work Lilias Trotter left: devotional books and leaflets, journals and letters, and thirty astonishingly beautiful page-a-day diaries. Lilias believed God has two textbooks--Scripture and Creation--and she studied both. Day by day, decade upon decade, through the seasons of her life, Lilias recorded in watercolors and words her observations filtered through her heavenly vision: God working out His purposes on a land and in a people.</p><p><i>"Lilias painted and wrote in obscurity with no concern for fame or recognition.

We weren't allowed to touch the box. The stories I heard as a little boy faded to a hazy dream, and my drawings from that time make no sense. I cannot decipher them. It was not until I myself had gone far, far away and received the message from my father that I became interested in the red box again . . .</p><p>In New York, Peter Sis receives a letter from his father. "The Red Box is now yours," it says. The brief note worries him and pulls him back to Prague, where the contents of the red box explain the mystery of his father's long absence during the 1950s.</p><p>Czechoslovakia was behind the iron curtain; Vladimir Sis, a documentary filmmaker of considerable talent, was drafted into the army and sent to China to teach filmmaking. He left his wife, daughter, and young son, Peter, thinking he would be home for Christmas. Two Christmases would pass before he was heard from again: Vladimir Sis was lost in Tibet. He met with the Dalai Lama; he witnessed China's invasion of Tibet. When he returned to Prague, he dared not talk to his friends about all he had seen and experienced. But over and over again he told Peter about his Tibetan adventures. Weaving their two stories together - that of the father lost in Tibet and that of the small boy in Prague, lost without his father - Sis draws from his father's diary and from his own recollections of his father's incredible tales to reach a spiritual homecoming between father and son. With his sublime pictures, inspired by Tibetan Buddhist art and linking history to memory, Peter Sis gives us an extraordinary book - a work of singular artistry and rare imagination. This title has Common Core connections.</p><p><i>Tibet Through the Red Box</i> is a 1999 Caldecott Honor Book and the winner of the 1999 Boston Globe - Horn Book Award for Special Citation.</p></p><p>As a child in 1950s Czechoslovakia, Caldecott Honor-winning artist Peter S�s would listen to mysterious tales of Tibet, "the roof of the world." The narrator, oddly enough, was his father--a documentary filmmaker who had been separated from his crew, caught in a blizzard, and (according to him, anyway) nursed back to health by gentle Yetis. Young S�s learned of a beautiful land of miracles and monks beset by a hostile China; of the 14th Dalai Lama, a "Boy-God-King"; and of "a magic palace with a thousand rooms--a room for every emotion and heart's desire." Hearing these accounts--some extravagant but all moving--helped the boy recover from an accident. The stories also allowed S�s's father to relate an odyssey other adults didn't seem to want to know about in cold war Czechoslovakia. "He told me, over and over again, his magical stories of Tibet, for that is where he had been. And I believed everything he said," S�s recalls. Still, after some time he too seemed to become immune, and the stories "faded to a hazy dream." With <i>Tibet: Through the Red Box</i> S�s finally pays tribute to this fantastical experience, illustrating key pages from his father's diary with complex, color-rich images of mazes, mountains, and mandalas. He also produces pictures of his family at home--simple, monochromatic images that are just as haunting as their Himalayan counterparts. In one, a wistful mother and two children gather around a Christmas tree, the absent father appearing as a featureless silhouette. <i>Tibet</i> is a treasure for the eyes and heart. Some will ask: Is it for children or adults? Others will wonder: Is it a work of art or a storybook? One of the many things that this book makes us realize is that such classifications are entirely (and happily) unnecessary. (Click to see a sample spread. Illustrations copyright �1998 by Peter S�s.

Builder and instructor Mitchell has developed a method of making such structures in modular sections. He takes the reader from tree to finished house, showing how to cut logs, hew them into workable sizes, and join them together. He also illustrates wall construction, making openings for windows and doors, and making foundations for differing site conditions. Although the techniques Mitchell uses are difficult, the instructions and illustrations are clear. Log construction has come a long way since Daniel Boone's time?axes have been traded for chain saws and routers?but working with logs is still heavy, dangerous work. Although safety is touched upon, it's assumed that the reader is experienced. Recommended for public libraries with extensive building collections.?Jonathan N. Hershey, Akron-Summit Cty.

Years later, reflecting on the many places he has visited as a travel broadcaster, Pete admits that he feels more at home in Ireland than anywhere. To find out whether this is due to rose-coloured spectacles or to a deeper tie with the country of his ancestors, Pete sets off on a trip around Ireland and discovers that it has changed in surprising ways. Firstly obeying the rule 'never pass a pub with your name on it', he encounters McCarthy's bars up and down the land, and meets English hippies, German musicians, married priests and many others. A funny, affectionate look at one of the most popular countries in the world.</p></p><p>Although Pete McCarthy was raised in England, his mother hails from West Cork and, despite never having lived there, he can't shake the strange feeling that Ireland is more home than home. A return pilgrimage reveals immediately why he (or anyone, for that matter) feels "involved and engaged" in Ireland. On arriving at the airport in Cork he's greeted by a guy in a giant rubber Celtic cross getup who's telling jokes with a latter-day St. Patrick (the guy who cast all snakes and pagans out of Ireland). Later, when McCarthy happens to mention that his surname matches that of the pub he's in (ever faithful to his Eighth Rule of Travel: Never pass a bar that has your name on it), the owner buys him a Guinness, invites him to her raucous all-night birthday party, then insists he move to Ireland because, well, obviously he belongs. McCarthy's Second Rule of Travel states: The more bright primary colours and ancient Celtic symbols outside the pub, the more phoney the interior. While the island is turning into a haven for upmarket tourists--and McCarthy offers outstanding examples of bumbleheaded tourists in action--he still finds plenty of pubs where you can buy a bicycle and which still exist primarily as venues for conversation and Irish music sessions.<p> While most travel writers seek out opportunities to meet the famous--or the infamous--McCarthy has the charming knack of just bumping into them on his rambles, which is how he met Noel Redding, formerly of Jimi Hendrix's band, and the author Frank McCourt. Far more interesting, though, are the eccentric and talkative bachelors and landladies who turn up in pubs, B&amp;Bs, and the middle of the road. McCarthy has mastered the art of getting creatively lost, wandering the back lanes of Ireland where the hype of tourism has yet to arrive, pursuing stone circles, impossibly romantic ruined abbeys, and, of course, pubs. What he discovers is that "In Ireland, the unexpected happens more than you expect," which makes for a hilarious tour through one of the most beautiful, friendly, and quirky places on earth with a comedian who has honed the art of telling a good story and of having fun.--<i>Lesley Reed</i></p><p><b>The #1 Irish Bestseller</b></p><p>Despite the many exotic places Pete McCarthy has visited, he finds that nowhere else can match the particular magic of Ireland, his mother's homeland. In <i>McCarthy's Bar</i>, his journey begins in Cork and continues along the west coast to Donegal in the north. Traveling through spectacular landscapes, but at all times obeying the rule, "never pass a bar that has your name on it," he encounters McCarthy's bars up and down the land, meeting fascinating people before pleading to be let out at four o'clock in the morning. </p><p>Written by someone who is at once an insider and an outside, <i>McCarthy's Bar</i> is a wonderfully funny and affectionate portrait of a rapidly changing country.</p><p>Praise for Pete McCarthy and<i> McCarthy's Bar</i>:</p><p>"[McCarthy] is a worthy addition to the ranks of P.J.

By the author of <i>The House of Sky. </i></p><p>IVAN DOIG was born in Montana in 1939 and grew up along the Rocky Mountain Front, the dramatic landscape that has inspired much of his writing. His first book, <i>This House of Sky,</i> was a finalist for the National Book Award in contemporary thought. &#x201c;The language begins in western territory and experience but in the hands of an artist it touches all landscape and all life,&#x201d; Robert Kirsch wrote in the <i>Los Angeles Times.</i> &#x201c;Doig is such an artist,&#x201d; Richard Critchfield added in the <i>Washington Post,</i> &#x201c;Nor is Doig&#x2019;s gift merely literary. Besides his intuitions and artistry there is the iron purpose of an ex-ranchhand who has earned his Ph.D. in history.&#x201d;This is the endearing story of a Montana man's reflections of growing up during a tumultuous, yet enlightening, time in history when life was slower, the landscape was environmentally protected, neighbors more supportive, and a boy's imagination could flourish. Doig describes in detail his mother and father's devotion for him and each other, and paints vivid portraits of a tightly knit family living in a rugged terrain and struggling for survival. After his mother's death, times got tougher, and Doig's portrayal of his dad's difficulties are touching. Poetic interludes are charming and contrast interestingly with Doig's portrayal of a wild and rugged Montana and its curious inhabitants. This unusual and beautifully expressed autobiography is a stunning work of art.

Now, Trigun goes beyond the storyline laid out in the anime and the first two volumes of the manga into brand new territory! Our hero Vash the Stampede disappeared for two years after blasting a crater onto the moon orbiting the desert planet he saved from annihilation. But, with good and bad people alike trying to track him down he won&#39;t stay lost for long! Count on more crazy gunslinger action, new dastardly villains... and a new outfit to boot!</p><p>A Western set on a desert planet, this series begins two years after the finale of the original Trigun and chronicles the return of retired super-gunslinger with a heart of gold Vash the Stampede. Vash&#x2019;s skills are so destructive that he is officially classified as a natural disaster, and once his return is made public, all manner of ordnance-wielding scum come out in an effort to claim the obscenely high bounty on his head. With a priest who carries a human-sized crucifix/machine gun, Vash makes his way from one bullet-riddled conflict to another, each exploit marked with humor. The well-drawn, though occasionally confusing, art manages to strike a delicate balance between the look needed for the Sergio Leone-esque spaghetti-Western-in-space feel and the script&#x2019;s tongue-in-cheek tone. The story assumes readers are familiar with the original series. That&#x2019;s not necessarily a bad thing though, since readers are thrown headlong into a unique science fiction environment and left to discover the ins and outs of its workings for themselves. It&#x2019;s one of the things that make this first volume worth a look for those seeking a bit of light, time-killing manga reading.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

At the same time, Wolfwood tracks down Vash to tell him that every man, woman, and child is missing from another village and the only clue is the name Knives scrawled across a monument. After they defeat the impostor, Vash and Wolfwood head out to track down Knives. Nightow has tightened up his storytelling here, and his artwork is fluid, with fine lines and lots of detail.

Over the last 30 years as wages have stagnated across the country, average household debt has more than doubled. Increasingly, people are forced to take on debt to meet their needs; from housing to education and medical care. The results&#x2014;wrecked lives, devastated communities, and an increasing reliance on credit to maintain basic living standards&#x2014;reveal an economic system that enriches the few at the expense of the many. Detailed strategies, resources, and insider tips for dealing with some of the most common kinds of debt are covered in this manual, including credit card debt, medical debt, student debt, and housing debt. It also contains tactics for navigating the pitfalls of personal bankruptcy, as well as information on how to be protected from credit reporting agencies, debt collectors, payday lenders, check-cashing outlets, rent-to-own stores, and more. Additional chapters cover tax debt, sovereign debt, the relationship between debt and climate, and an expanded vision for a movement of mass debt resistance.</p></p><p><p><b>Strike Debt</b> emerged out of thematic assemblies held in May 2012 in solidarity with the student strikes in Montreal. Occupy Theory, Occupy Student Debt Campaign, and Free University collaborated to hold an assembly on Education and Debt. Several weeks later, the group continued to meet under the name "Strike Debt." Strike Debt quickly realized that organizing around all forms of debt provided much-needed energy and systematic analysis to the movement. </p><p> </p><p>In addition to this manual, Strike Debt initiatives include launching the "Rolling Jubilee," a mutual-aid project that buys debt at steeply discounted prices and then abolishes it; hosting debtors' assemblies; and planning direct actions across the country, ranging from debt burnings to targeted shutdowns of predatory lenders. Each project is seen as a strike against the predatory debt system.</p><p>&#x201c;That debt is neither inevitable nor ethical is one of the powerful assertions of Strike Debt, whose brilliant manual is both a practical handbook and a manifesto for a true debt jubilee: an economic rebirth in which the indebted are freed and financial institutions are reinvented.&#x201d; &nbsp;&#x2014;Rebecca Solnit, author, <i>A Paradise Built in Hell: The Extraordinary Communities That Arise in Disaster</i><br><br></p><p>&#x201c;Two tasks for those who care about the health of the society: change the design, and find ways to cope as effectively with the failures it imposes.

An eye-opening reworking of our common myth pool.Marina Warner is the author of four novels and many works of nonfiction, notably <i>Alone of All Her Sex </i>and<i> Monuments and Maidens</i>.

He travels to San Francisco to speak at a meeting of agricultural experts and as he roams the city streets at night, his missing hand becomes a portal into all things missing--love, descendants, and even the family farms that are being replaced by agribusiness. (The book is set in 1976.) There&#39;s a spirituality hovering over the proceedings and, like Andy&#39;s missing hand, it permeates everything without making itself seen. The audiobook&#39;s power has a lot to do with Michael Kramer&#39;s narration. Kramer reads as if he were painting, applying sentences like minimalist brush strokes. The result is a meditative, hypnotizing audiobook. R.W.S.

Wrong, as abundantly proved by Diane Kochilas's masterful <i>The Glorious Foods of Greece</i>. For over 10 years, Kochilas investigated the vast wealth of Greek cooking, traveling to its islands, cities, mountains, and villages and talking to cooks, bakers, fisherman, farmers, and cheese makers. She listened astutely, and the result is not only hundreds of authentic recipes, but a definitive culinary guide. <p> Following an introduction in which Kochilas details, among other fascinating information, the nature of each region's cuisine (Rooumali and Epirus are shepherds' domains, she writes, "where the reigning food is <i>pita</i>, as in savory pie, hundreds of them...."), she then offers chapter-by-chapter observations with straightforward recipes. These range from <i>mezze</i> (appetizers) and soups to breads, main dishes, sweets, and drinks. From the olive country of Peloponnesus, for example, readers are offered the likes of Roast Leg of Lamb with Wine, Garlic, Allspice, and Cheese. The Italian-influenced Ionian islands provide Chicken Stewed in Fragrant Tomato Sauce with Thick Pasta, among other dishes. Snd from Macedonia and Thrace come such fare as Roasted Potato Salad with Hot Pepper and Mint, and Leek and Yogurt Pie. </p><p> Throughout, Kochilas also provides interesting sidebars (The Sardines of Lesvos, for example, profiles this local treasure known for its sweetness), ingredient sketches, and preparation suggestions. A section that explores cooking techniques and a useful source list concludes the book, which is a tribute to a widely undiscovered cuisine and the author's steady yet exuberant powers of investigation. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p>Diane Kochilas, a native New Yorker who adopted Athens in the early 1990s as her home, is the author of two other books on Greek cuisine, <i>The Food and Wine of Greece</i> and <i>The Greek Vegetarian.</i> She has contributed to many American and international publications, including <i>Saveur, Food &amp; Wine,</i> and the <i>New York Times.</i> She is the regular food columnist and restaurant critic for Greece's largest daily newspaper, <i>Ta Nea.</i> Diane also teaches and lectures on Greek cuisine and culture around the world and keeps her hand in a few restaurant kitchens in New York and Athens, cooking and consulting.</p><h2>Clouds Of Witness (Lord Peter Wimsey Mysteries)</h2><p>Clouds of Witness</p><p>Dorothy L Sayers was born in Oxford in 1893, and was both a classical scholar and a graduate in modern languages. As well as her popular Lord Peter Wimsey series, she wrote several religious plays, but considered her translations of Dante&#39;s Divina Commedia to be her best work. She died in 1957. www.sayers.org.ukLord Peter Wimsey brings his investigations close to home when called to solve questions in a murder in which his brother-in-law, the Duke of Denver, is the main suspect. The abridgment necessitates careful listening to keep track of the storyline. Petherbridge portrays a perfect Wimsey, his own role for the BBC television series, but other characters and the background narration are less distinguished. The reader delivers the final summation in court with great energy and a sparkling presentation of motives and emotions. The overall effect will amuse Sayers&#39;s fans. R.F.W.

Special coverage is given also to team games, building successful partnerships and conventions most regularly used by experts. Finally, there is a designated self-study program to help you be the very best you can be. The unique things about this book are that: <p>(1) It is the first book in 40 years to deal with the entire game of bridge. </p><p>(2) It represents the modern thinking of today's experts who win national championships. </p><p>(3) It is especially well-organized and easy to read. </p><p>For these reasons the book received the "1997 Book of the Year" award from the American Bridge Teacher's Association and continues to be a best-seller at national tournaments.</p></p><p>In his youth, Burt Hall was selected to play with Charles Goren when the great master was playing with local talent at regional events. Because of other demands he retired from tournament bridge in his twenties. During the mid-1980&#39;s, three decades later, he returned to tournament bridge to find dramatic changes in the game and the literature much enriched. Not hindered by the past, he became a keen observer of the modern approach to bridge and the winning ways of the experts. Eventually, Burt formed a partnership with his present wife and favorite partner, Lynn Rose-Hall. They have established an enviable record and have amassed several thousand master points in local, regional and national events.

Arranged alphabetically by performer for easy reference, these 2,800 capsule reviews concisely recall the musical highlights--and low points--of the last ten years of rock &#39;n&#39; roll.</p><p>The Grand Poobah of Rock Criticism and longtime <i>Village Voice</i> contributor rates 3,000 releases in this dandy book, which belongs on the night table of every self-respecting music fan. Robert Christgau's tastes are admirably catholic: refusing to limit himself to solid rock, he takes on rap, hardcore, country, blues, reggae, worldbeat, and everything in between. His vest-pocket pronunciamentos are always fun to read--even when they seem perversely wrongheaded--and who else would zoom in on Ruben Blades's "ability to skip along the shores of schlock without ruining his best pair of shoes," or refer to "Amazing Grace" as "the 'Send in the Clowns' of roots music"? Who else, for that matter, could <i>almost</i> persuade you to run out and pick up <i>The Very Best of Deep Purple</i>?The "glib and oily art" (as Shakespeare might say) of rock music criticism is on full parade in Christgau's compilation of 2800 1980s rock album reviews, most of which are lifted as is from Christgau's "Consumer Guide" column in The Village Voice . Arrangement is alphabetical by recording artist, and each entry, generally 50 to 150 words in length, includes album name, label, release date, and a letter grade. Introductory essays on 1980s trends and developments and appendixes of artists neglected in the reviews are included. Christgau's catholic tastes provide a wonderful cornucopia, but the cumulative effect of his terminally hip prose and gymnastic verbal constructions ("boho Americanism," "antipunk discowave," "postprog art-rock," "mucho pusho," etc.) is vacuous. Ira Robbins's The New Trouser Press Record Guide ( LJ 3/1/89; 3d ed.) is a superior choice for its depth and information.<br><i>- Barry Miller, Austin P.L., Tex.</i><br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Sterling Point Books: Joan of Arc: Warrior Saint</h2><p>Could any story be more inspiring than that of Joan of Arc, the courageous maiden who fought for the glory of France and God? Guided by what she firmly believed were visions of saints, this young Frenchwoman&#x2014;still just 16 years old&#x2014;led her people in battle against the British occupiers. Though she proved victorious in war, Joan ultimately became a martyr when some of her own countrymen betrayed her to the English. Jay Williams captures all the tragedy and pathos of the fearless country girl who was finally recognized as a saint herself.</p><p></p><h2>Golden Mouth: The Story of John Chrysostom�Ascetic, Preacher, Bishop</h2><p>During the past few years, there has been a growing interest among evangelicals in the early Church Fathers, evidenced by various publications concerning this period in the church's history: The Apostolic Fathers, The Ante-Nicene and The Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, and the new Ancient Christian Commentary series. Though these publications are comprehensive in scope, they lack in-depth analysis of the lives of select individuals, including John Chrysostom, a gifted Fourth-century orator and Christian witness. <p>The last significant English work on Chrysostom's life was Saint John Chrysostom: His Life and Times by W. R. W. Stephen, first published in 1880. For the past thirty-five years, scholars interested in the study of Chrysostom have had to rely on the two-volume work by C. Baur, published in German in 192930 and translated into English in 1959. Kelly's <i>Golden Mouth</i> is the first scholarly work to appear on the academic scene in the last forty years. </p><p>In this erudite study, Kelly covers the complete story of John Chrysostom's life. He describes Chrysostom's life in Antioch as a young boy, his days as a monk outside the city, his years as a preacher, his unexpected promotion to the episcopate in the imperial capital of Constantinople, his conflict with the royal household and fellow bishops, his exile to the harsh region of Armenia, and his death. <i>Golden Mouth</i> is a great resource for pastors, scholars, and students interested in the Patristic period and is an excellent companion to The Apostolic Fathers.</p></p><p>A Choice magazine &#34;Outstanding Academic Book&#34;Kelly knows the texts, and is a master of the ecclesiastical background and of the scholarly literature. -- <i>Journal of Ecclesiastical History</i><br><br>Looking at what Kelly has produced, it is clear that the educated reader and the scholar will find this story informative and interesting, and any serious student of Chrysostom will have to begin with this book. -- <i>Theological Studies</i><br><br>No other author has delved so deeply into the life and work of this complex, influential, and tragic figure of the fourth century and produced such a far-ranging but precise, solidly researched, and eminently readable account. . . . Chrysostom emerges as a sympathetic and tragic figure of great integrity, whose human failings contributed and perhaps led to his downfall. . . . Kelly has used a careful analysis of many of John's writings and sermons to present new insights and to confirm details of Chrysostom's life previously considered doubtful; his comments and summaries stimulate one to turn to the originals. Those who are interested in Chrysostom or in this historical period must read this book. -- <i>Catholic Historical Review</i><br><br>This is a book to relish rather than take apart, and I fully recommend it to historians and theologians alike. It is a fitting climax to a lifetime of distinguished scholarly output. -- <i>Journal of Theological Studies</i></p><h2>Percy Jackson&#39;s Greek Gods</h2><p>Who could tell the origin stories of the gods of Olympus better than a modern-day demigod?

In this fluent autobiography, starting with her "discovery" in 1941 by Benny Goodman, she describes her years of suffering and romancefrom her childhood, when she was constantly beaten by her stepmother, to her various love affairs and four marriages. Her low self-esteem is confirmed or denied (depending on the reader's point of view) by her frequent naming of prominent people who are/were close friends (Sinatra and Cary Grant), for whom she made breakfast, or who were merely in her audience. She gushes about the songs she wrote or made famous, about her dogs, her granddaughter, her daughter's paintings, her double-bypass surgery. Still, P. L., as she refers to herself, has been an international star for more than 40 years and she did single-handedly revive the supper-club business, so her many fans will welcome her sticking to her guns and admitting that she's still growing up. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc."Miss Lee's" autobiography is straight from the heart. Her reminiscences are revealing of her difficult North Dakota childhood at the hands of an abusive stepmother, and her innocence in the tough world of show business as she started to shine as a major singer/songwriter. Marriages, poor health, and a few lawsuits did not dampen her spirit; faith, family, and friends provided strength and levity. This is a delightful autobiography in her own words, and public libraries should certainly add it to their collections.<br><i>- Virginia A. Doser, Saddleback Coll.

The warm glow of the yellows of a carriage made from a rose, the lion pulling it, and a dress made from yellow roses achieves luminescence on paper, heightened by the intense greens, reds, and blues of the countryside and playhouse. The yellow changes to rich gold as the sun sets. The variation in picture size, from small close-ups of the dolls to elongated spreads, adds flow to the day's happening and lends a cinematic quality. The combination of vibrant colors, strong composition, and margin motif together frame a sensation, like a daydream visualized. That the friend may be imagined only adds to the book's appeal. As with Berger's previous books, Grandfather Twilight (1984) and Donkey's Dream (1985, both Philomel) , this picture book provides a vivid showcase for a simple story.

Scott Fitzgerald&#39;s last completed novel, Tender is the Night is edited by Arnold Goldman with an introduction and notes by Richard Godden in Penguin Modern Classics. Between the First World War and the Wall Street Crash the French Riviera was the stylish place for wealthy Americans to visit. Among the most fashionable are psychoanalyst Dick Diver and his wife Nicole, who hold court at their villa. Into their circle comes Rosemary Hoyt, a film star, who is instantly attracted to them, but understands little of the dark secrets and hidden corruption that hold them together. As Dick draws closer to Rosemary, he fractures the delicate structure of his marriage and sets both Nicole and himself on to a dangerous path where only the strongest can survive. In this exquisite, lyrical novel, Fitzgerald has poured much of the essence of his own life; he has also depicted the age of materialism, shattered idealism and broken dreams. F. Scott Fitzgerald (1896-1940) has acquired a mythical status in American literary history, and his masterwork The Great Gatsby is considered by many to be the &#39;great American novel&#39;. In 1920 he married Zelda Sayre, dubbed &#39;the first American Flapper&#39;, and their traumatic marriage and Zelda&#39;s gradual descent into insanity became the leading influence on his writing. As well as many short stories, Fitzgerald wrote five novels This Side of Paradise, The Great Gatsby, The Beautiful and the Damned, Tender is the Night and, incomplete at the time of his death, The Last Tycoon. After his death The New York Times said of him that &#39;in fact and in the literary sense he created a &#34;generation&#34; &#39;. If you enjoyed Tender is the Night, you might like Truman Capote&#39;s Breakfast at Tiffany&#39;s, also available in Penguin Classics. &#39;One of the most wonderful writers of the twentieth century&#39; Financial Times</p><p>In the wake of World War I, a community of expatriate American writers established itself in the salons and cafes of 1920s Paris. They congregated at Gertrude Stein's select soirees, drank too much, married none too wisely, and wrote volumes--about the war, about the Jazz Age, and often about each other. F. Scott Fitzgerald and his wife, Zelda, were part of this gang of literary Young Turks, and it was while living in France that Fitzgerald began writing <i>Tender Is the Night</i>. Begun in 1925, the novel was not actually published until 1934. By then, Fitzgerald was back in the States and his marriage was on the rocks, destroyed by Zelda's mental illness and alcoholism. Despite the modernist mandate to keep authors and their creations strictly segregated, it's difficult <i>not</i> to look for parallels between Fitzgerald's private life and the lives of his characters, psychiatrist Dick Diver and his former patient turned wife, Nicole. Certainly the hospital in Switzerland where Zelda was committed in 1929 provided the inspiration for the clinic where Diver meets, treats, and then marries the wealthy Nicole Warren. And Fitzgerald drew both the European locale and many of the characters from places and people he knew from abroad.<p> In the novel, Dick is eventually ruined--professionally, emotionally, and spiritually--by his union with Nicole. Fitzgerald's fate was not quite so novelistically neat: after Zelda was diagnosed as a schizophrenic and committed, Fitzgerald went to work as a Hollywood screenwriter in 1937 to pay her hospital bills. He died three years later--not melodramatically, like poor Jay Gatsby in his swimming pool, but prosaically, while eating a chocolate bar and reading a newspaper. Of all his novels, <i>Tender Is the Night</i> is arguably the one closest to his heart. As he himself wrote, "<i>Gatsby</i> was a tour de force, but this is a confession of faith."</p>In Tender Is The Night, Fitzgerald deliberately set out to write the most ambitious and far-reaching novel of his career, experimenting radically with narrative conventions of chronology and point of view and drawing on early breakthroughs in psychiatry to enrich his account of the makeup and breakdown of character and culture.</p><h2>Honor &amp; Respect: The Official Guide to Names, Titles, and Forms of Address</h2><p>"An essential purchase for all libraries." -- Library Journal, December 2008 The book contains more forms of address than are available in any other book.

She recently retired as professor of ascetical theology at The General Theological Seminary in New York, where she was the director of its Center for Christian Spirituality. Her other books include <i>Holy Listening: The Art of Spiritual Direction</i> and <i>Toward Holy Ground: Spiritual Directions for the Second Half of Life</i>.Margaret Guenther is a lot of things&#x2015;a professor of theology, an author, a retreat leader and an Episcopal priest. But in her latest book, <i>The Practice of Prayer</i>, it is evident that first and foremost she is just like the rest of us, human&#x2015;allible, vulnerable and all the other things that go along with the human condition. <i>The Practice of Prayer</i> is refreshingly down-to-earth. In this book Guenther talks about prayer and paths to hearing God in a way that makes readers feel they are sitting by a fire having one of those deep and meaningful talks with their best friend. It's the kind of talk you later recall as having been one where a lot of the world's perplexing problems were solved. (Cynthia Jardon <i>Alexandria Daily Town Talk</i>)<br><br>Margaret Guenther has provided the church with a wise and gentle book in <i>The Practice of Prayer</i>, and the chapter subtitles indicate the warmth and sparkle of her text.... I could wish for no more comprehensive, accessible, and gracious text for leading adults to an understanding of the realities of prayer, though I do wish she had made some mention of the renewal of interest in the labyrinth as a tool for meditation and prayer. These volumes occasion in me hopefulness for the church. The author takes seriously the lives of her potential readers, credits them with insight and ability, and invites them into mature knowledge and understanding. I hope the book finds pastors and teachers who share the author's faith in the wisdom of our times and our people. (Scott Lee, St. Mark's Church)<br><br>Do not be misled by the title. This is not a how-to manual for prayer. It is much more valuable than that. ... Instead of promoting six easy steps to more exciting prayer, Guenther offers a simple, powerful reminder: prayer is work and work is prayer. (Robert P. Mills <i>The Presbyterian Layman</i>)<br><br>This is a practical and readable book on the essentials of prayer, presented by Episcopal priest Margaret Guenther. Her opening pages are inviting. She tells us that even she is humbled at the thought of &#x2018;teaching' someone how to pray. Margaret Guenther's presentation is less formal theology and more gleanings from wisdom, her own and that passed down the ages. Not that her work is &#x2018;non-theological.' In fact, it is, and deeply so. But her book is God-talk that is conscious of the fact that the Word became flesh, like us. And so we live in the flesh, always seeking the Spirit. Margaret Guenther's practicality includes a number of recommended texts, both classic and recent, to assist the practitioner in the practice of prayer. Her book is a place to begin, or to begin again. (Phyllis Zagano <i>Anglican Theological Review</i>)<br><br>If you have been searching for a book that can serve as a guide for yourself or for others, search no longer. Margaret Guenther has written an insightful, accessible, earthy book on prayer and the spiritual life. She has the extraordinary ability to engage her readers at diverse levels and to impart wisdom that is at once simple and profound. . . . This book can be used in a variety of ways, to inform the individual reader, to inspire a book study, or to guide a group in the exploration of prayer. Guenther provides a section of questions to use for group conversation or as exercises to practice for the individual or a group. Several books are published on the life of prayer, but this book is outstanding among them. Even a person most experienced in prayer will find Guenther's insights, on even the most familiar topics, refreshing and new. <i>The Practice of Prayer</i> is a must for every person's library.

The descent into madness is recounted by the unnamed narrator in increasingly urgent and disjointed prose, as he loses his grip on reality.</p><p>Arising from Hamsun's belief that literature ought to be about the mysterious workings of the human mind -- an attempt, he wrote, to describe "the whisper of the blood and the pleading of the bone marrow" -- <i>Hunger</i> is a landmark work that pointed the way toward a new kind of novel. </p><p>"The whole modern school of fiction in the twentieth century stems from Hamsun. They were all Hamsun's disciples: Thomas Mann and Arthur Schnitzler . . . and even such American writers are Fitzgerald and Hemingway." &#x2015;Isaac Bashevis Singer</p></p><p><b>Knut Hamsun</b> (1859-1952) was a Norwegian novelist, poet, and playwright. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1920. He is the author of books including <i>Hunger</i> and <i>Mysteries</i>.<p>&#x201c;Something new is happening here, some new thought about the nature of art is being proposed in <i>Hunger</i>. An art that is indistinguishable from the life of the artist who makes it . . . an art that is the direct expression of the effort to express itself.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Paul Auster (from his introduction)</i></p><p>&#x201c;The whole modern school of fiction in the twentieth century stems from Hamsun. They were all Hansun's disciples: Thomas Mann and Arthur Schnitzler . . . and even such American writers as Fitzgerald and Hemingway.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Isaac Bashevis Singer</i></p><p>&#x201c;After reading <i>Hunger</i>, one can easily understand why Hamsun was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. <i>Hunger </i>should appeal to any reader who is interested in a masterpiece by one of this century's great novelists.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>James Goldwasser, Detroit News</i></p></p><h2>The Merchant of Venice (Ignatius Critical Editions)</h2><p>The Merchant of Venice is probably the most controversial of all Shakespeare&#39;s plays. It is also one of the least understood. Is it a comedy or a tragedy? What is the meaning behind the test of the caskets? Who is the real villain of the trial scene? Is Shylock simply vicious and venomous, or is he more sinned against than sinning? Can the play be described as anti-semitic? What exactly is the quality of mercy? Is Portia one of the great Christian heroines of western literature? And what of the comedy of the rings with which Shakespeare ends the play? These questions and many others are answered in this critical edition of one of the Bard&#39;s liveliest plays.</p><p>The Merchant of Venice has been performed more often than any other comedy by Shakespeare. This edition pays special attention to the expectations of its first audience, and to our modern experience of seeing and hearing the play.This is one of Shakespeare&#39;s darkest comedies, for the romantic story of a young man, Bassanio, who has squandered his fortune and must borrow money to woo the wealthy lady he loves is set against the most disturbing story of the Jewish moneylender Shylock and his demand for the &#34;pound of flesh&#34; owed him by the Venetian merchant, Antonio, who has fallen into Shylock&#39;s debt. Here pathos and farce combine with moral complexity and romantic entanglement to display the extraordinary power and range of Shakespeare at his best.</p><h2>First Thousand Words in Spanish: With Internet-Linked Pronunciation Guide (English and Spanish Edition)</h2><p>Includes everyday words accompanied by illustrations and a pronunication guide.</p><p>Text: English, Spanish</p><h2>Giovanni&#39;s Room: Introduction by Colm T�ib�n (Everyman&#39;s Library Contemporary Classics Series)</h2><p><p>James Baldwin&#x2019;s groundbreaking novel about love and the fear of love is set among the bohemian bars and nightclubs of 1950s Paris.<br><br>David is a young American expatriate who has just proposed marriage to his girlfriend, Hella.

It seemed to him that the cast-iron stove in themiddle of his office with its chimney tube rising to the ceiling wasn&#x2019;troaring properly. He pushed the telegram away, rose ponderously to his feet,adjusted the flue and thrust three shovels of coal into the firebox.</p><p>Then he stood with his back to thestove, filled his pipe and adjusted his stud collar, which was irritating his neckeven though it wasn&#x2019;t set very high.</p><p>He glanced at his watch. Four p.m. Hisjacket was hanging on a hook on the back of the door.</p><p>Slowly he returned to his desk, mouthinga translation as he went:</p><p></p><p>International Criminal PoliceCommission to Police Judiciaire in Paris: Krakow police report sighting Pietrthe Latvian en route to Bremen.</p><p></p><p>The International Criminal PoliceCommission, or ICPC, is based in Vienna. Broadly speaking, it oversees the struggleagainst organized crime in Europe, with a particular responsibility for liaisonbetween the various national police forces on the Continent.</p><p>Maigret pulled up another telegram that was similarlywritten in IPC, the secret international police code used for communication betweenall the world&#x2019;s police forces. He translated at sight:</p><p></p><p>Polizei-Pr�sidium Bremen to PJParis: Pietr the Latvian reported en route Amsterdam and Brussels.</p><p></p><p>Another telegram from the NederlandscheCentrale in Zake Internationale Misdadigers, the Dutch police HQ, reported:</p><p></p><p>At 11 a.m. Pietr the Latvianboarded �toile du Nord, compartment G. 263, car 5, destination Paris.</p><p></p><p>The final message in IPC had been sentfrom Brussels and said:</p><p></p><p>Confirm Pietr the Latvian on board�toile du Nord via Brussels 2 a.m. in compartment reported by Amsterdam.</p><p></p><p>Behind Maigret&#x2019;s desk there was ahuge map pinned to the wall. The inspector was a broad and heavy man. He stoodstaring at the map with his hands in his pockets and his pipe sticking out the sideof his mouth.</p><p>His eyes travelled from the dotrepresenting Krakow to the other dot showing the port of Bremen and from there toAmsterdam and Paris.</p><p>He checked the time once again.Four-twenty. The �toile du Nord should now be hurtling along at sixty miles an hourbetween Saint-Quentin and Compi�gne.</p><p>It wouldn&#x2019;t stop at the border. Itwouldn&#x2019;t be slowing down.</p><p>In car 5, compartment G. 263, Pietr theLatvian was presumably spending his time reading or looking at the scenery.</p><p>Maigret went over to a door that openedonto a closet, washed his hands in an enamelbasin, ran a comb through thick dark-brown hair flecked with only a few silverstrands around the temple, and did his best to straighten out his tie &#x2013; he&#x2019;dnever learned how to do a proper knot.</p><p>It was November and it was getting dark.Through the window he could see a branch of the Seine, Place Saint-Michel, and afloating wash-house, all in a blue shroud speckled by gas lamps lighting up oneafter the other.</p><p>He opened a drawer and glanced at adispatch from the International Identification Bureau in Copenhagen.</p><p></p><p>Paris PJ Pietr-le-Letton 32 16901512 0224 0255 02732 03116 03233 03243 03325 03415 03522 04115 04144 0414705221&nbsp;...</p><p></p><p>This time he made an effort to speak thetranslation aloud and even went over it several times, like a schoolchild reciting alesson:</p><p></p><p>Description Pietr the Latvian:apparent age 32 years, height 169 cm, sinus top straight line, bottom flat,extension large max, special feature septum not visible, ear unmarked rim, lobelarge, max cross and dimension small max, protuberant antitragus, vex edge lowerfold, edge shape straight line edge feature separate lines, orthognathous upper,long face, biconcave, eyebrows thin fair light, lower lip jutting max thicklower droop, light.</p><p></p><p>This &#x2018;word-picture&#x2019; of Pietrwas as clear as a photograph to Inspector Maigret. The principal features were thefirst to emerge: the man was short, slim, young and fair-haired, with sparse blondeyebrows, greenish eyes and a long neck.</p><p>Maigret now also knew the shape of hisear in the minutest detail. This would enable him to make a positive identificationin a milling crowd even if the suspect was in disguise.</p><p>He took his jacket off the hook andslipped his arms into it, then put on a heavy black overcoat and a bowler hat.</p><p>One last glance at the stove, whichseemed on the verge of exploding.</p><p>At the end of the corridor, on the stairlanding that was used as a waiting room, he reminded Jean:</p><p>&#x2018;You won&#x2019;t forget to keep mystove going, will you?&#x2019;</p><p>The wind swirling up the stairs took himby surprise, and he had to shelter from the draught in a corner to get his pipe tolight.</p><p>Wind and rain blew in squalls over theplatforms of Gare du Nord despite the monumental glass canopy overhead.

She kept on telling the boywhat he should do, right up to the last minute. In his embarrassment he had nochoice but to promise not to go out on deck.</p><p>Maigret stood near platform 11 wherepeople were awaiting the arrival of the �toile du Nord. All the leading hotels, aswell as Thomas Cook, had their agents standing by.</p><p>He stood still. Other people wereagitated. A young woman clad in mink yetwearing only sheer silk stockings walked up and down, stamping her heels.</p><p>He just stood there: a hulk of a man,with shoulders so broad as to cast a wide shadow.

Then came the usual hubbub, with porters shoutingand passengers tramping and jostling their way towards the station exit.</p><p>A couple of hundred passengers paradedpast Maigret before he picked out in the crowd a short man wearing a broad-checkedgreen travelling cape of a distinctly Nordic cut and colour.</p><p>The man wasn&#x2019;t in a hurry.

He looked hard at theman&#x2019;s ear. That was all he needed.</p><p>The man in green passed close by. One ofhis porters bumped Maigret with one of the suitcases.</p><p>At exactly the same moment a railwayemployee began to run, shouting out something to his colleague standing at thestation end of the platform, next to the barrier.</p><p>The chain was drawn closed.

Somebody wasrunning somewhere. Beside one of the carriages of the �toile du Nord there was asmall group waiting for something. Three of them, in railway company livery.</p><p>The stationmaster got to them first. Hewas a large man and had a worried look on his face. Then a hospital stretcher waswheeled through the main hall, past clumps of people who looked at it uneasily,especially those about to depart.</p><p>Maigret walked up the side of the trainwith his usual heavy tread, smoking as he went. Carriage 1, carriage2&nbsp;...&nbsp;He came to carriage 5.</p><p>That&#x2019;s where the group wasstanding at the door. The stretcher came to a halt. The stationmaster tried tolisten to the three men, who were all speaking at the same time.</p><p>&#x2018;Police! Where is he?&#x2019;</p><p>Maigret&#x2019;s presence providedobvious relief. He propelled his placid mass towards the centre of the franticgroup. The other men instantly became his satellites.</p><p>&#x2018;In the toilet&nbsp;...&#x2019;</p><p>Maigret hauled himself up onto the trainand saw that the toilet door on his rightwas open.

His guileless polychrome sculptures evoke both social history and emotion. His use of talismans give the viewer a window to another time, be it through old construction nails symbolising power and strength to a small West African paper mach, stool that stands apart as a symbol of nobility. Dedicated to the children of New Orleans, this is the first publication to examine Birch&#39;s career whose re-imagining of African and Southern folk art inspires thought provoking discussions as well as contemporary sculpture and design. It includes two essays and an interview with the artist, as well as colour reproductions of key works dating from 1968-2004.</p><p>David Rubin is the curator of Visual Arts at the Contemporary Arts Centre, New Orleans.</p><h2>The Shark and the Goldfish: Positive Ways to Thrive During Waves of Change</h2><p>The Shark and the Goldfish: Positive Ways to Thrive During Waves of Change</p><p><p>An illustrated business fable that gives you the faith, courage and confidence to win in today's tough economic climate</p> <p>Fear and uncertainty are staples of daily life in today's struggling economy. As bad as things can be, economic downturns also lead to new opportunities. It's easy to worry, give up and let fear paralyze you. However, you have more control than you think you do and how you handle adversity is your choice-and the only choice that matters. In fact, study history and you'll find that a lot of people and organizations made a name for themselves and grew their businesses during recessions and downturns. These successful people and organizations all shared similar characteristics and took similar actions to thrive while others merely tried to survive. You can do the same. </p><p>In <i>The Shark and the Goldfish, </i>Jon Gordon shares an inspiring fable about Gordy, a pampered goldfish who gets swept out to sea. Desperate for food, Gordy meets a kind shark who teaches him the ultimate lesson-Goldfish wait to be fed. Sharks go find food. Gordy also learns that the difference between a full and empty stomach is our faith, beliefs and actions. In the face of adversity and lean times, this is a business fable that reinforces a proven truth: You can't control the events in your life. But you can control how you respond and in turn this determines the outcome. </p><ul> <li>A business fable that teaches valuable lessons on the importance of working hard, maintaining a locus of control and focusing on positive choices instead of negative voices,</li> <li>Written by Jon Gordon, bestselling author of <i>The Energy Bus </i>and <i>The No Complaining Rule</i></li> <li>Reveals how change is inevitable-but that you can make it your friend or foe.</li> <li>Provides an action plan filled with tips and strategies to thrive during change and adversity</li> </ul> <p>If you're facing tough economic times, <i>The Shark and the Goldfish</i> will motivate you, inspire you, and give you the confidence you need to thrive during changing times. </p> <b>5 Ways to Stay Positive During Changing Times</b> <br>Amazon-exclusive content from author Jon Gordon <p></p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <b>1. Tell Yourself a Positive Story</b>&#x2014;Life is a story, and the story we tell ourselves and the role we play determines the quality and direction of our life. The most successful people are able to overcome adversity by telling themselves a more positive story than the rest. Instead of a drama or a horror movie, they define their life as an inspirational tale. Instead of being the victim, they see themselves as a fighter and over-comer. Those who are able to thrive during tough times have what&#x2019;s called a "locus of control", which means that while they can&#x2019;t control the market conditions, through their positive attitude, faith and actions, they believe they have an influence on the outcome of their story...and as a result they do. <p></p> <b>2. Model Success</b>&#x2014;Whenever I speak to a company, I always interview the leadership team and ask them if there are people who are succeeding during this challenging time. The answer is always "yes". I then interview these people who are succeeding and share their habits with the audience (with their approval of course). You can do the same. Find out who in your market is thriving, ask to meet with them, learn from them and model their attitude and actions. If they can do it, so can you. <p></p> <b>3. Zoom Focus</b>&#x2014;Now is the time to tune out the negative voices and focus on your choices. All that matters is the choices you make and the actions you take each day to grow yourself, your team and your business. Your job every day is to stay positive and take positive action. Be like the real estate agent who told me that she doesn't focus on the negative things the other agents in her office say. She doesn&#x2019;t focus on the negativity in the media. She focuses on what she can do every day to be successful. She focuses on marketing her business, taking care of her clients, and building loyal relationships. To help you "Zoom Focus", ask yourself this question each morning, &#x201c;What are the three most important things I need to do today that will help me create the success I desire?&#x201d; Then, each day, take action on those three things. <p></p> <b>4. Post a Sign &#x201c;No Energy Vampires Allowed&#x201d;</b>&#x2014;Post this sign in your mind and in your office. Gandhi said &#x201c;I will not allow anyone to walk through my mind with their dirty feet,&#x201d; and neither should you. This sign will signal to others that you are staying positive and you expect people to interact with you in a positive way. Don't buy into the pessimism of others. Instead, invite your team on your bus for a positive ride. <p></p> <b>5. Turn Negative Energy into Positive Solutions</b>&#x2014;Invoke <i>The No Complaining Rule</i> and practice it yourself. Utilize your own complaining as a catalyst for positive change and positive action. Let your complaints help you identify what you don&#x2019;t want so you can focus on what you do want. The key is to turn complaints into solutions. <p></p> <b>5 Ways to Stay Positive During Your Job Search</b> <br>Amazon-exclusive content from author Jon Gordon <p></p> <b>1. Say to yourself, &#x201c;I have a dream.&#x201d; Then start working to achieve it.</b> Having studied many successful people, I found that they all can pinpoint the moment where they decided what they truly wanted to achieve in life. It&#x2019;s a practice that should be required for all of us. After all, if you know what you truly want out of life then you will do whatever it takes to make it happen. Obvious as this may sound, many people never take the time to discover it. They live on autopilot, letting circumstances shape their days and months and years and decades. When I lost my job years ago, I realized that though I was initially sad to lose it I hadn&#x2019;t been truly happy. So, I took a moment and asked myself what I truly wanted to do with my life. What was I born to do? I asked. &#x2018;Why am I here?&#x2019; After a few days of thinking, the idea to open a franchise restaurant, which would hopefully allow me time to write, popped in my head. And off I went toward achieving my dream. <p></p> <b>2. Choose to have faith in what you want, rather than what you don&#x2019;t want.</b> Try out this riddle: What do fear and faith have in common? The answer: A future that hasn&#x2019;t happened yet. So why would you choose to paint that future bleak and empty, when you could paint it vibrant and fulfilling and fun? Fear believes in a negative future while faith believes in a positive future. Even if you&#x2019;re not a spiritual person, why would you choose to believe the worst is going to happen? It just feels better to look to the positive future. <p></p> <b>3. Start each day with &#x201c;three questions.&#x201d;</b> When you get up each morning, ask yourself this one question, "What are the 3 things I need to do today that will help me find the job and create the success that I desire?" Then, take action on those 3 things every day until you&#x2019;ve achieved them. This is a great way to keep feeding your positive energy. <p></p> <b>4. Take on a &#x201c;glass 92 percent full&#x201d; approach to the recession.</b> Today&#x2019;s employment-related statistics can be hard to get out of your head when you&#x2019;re searching for a job. But unlike the pundits on TV who seem all too pleased to focus on the most negative numbers available, you can choose to focus on the flip side. Rather than fixating on 10 percent unemployment, focus on 90 percent employment. Dwelling on the higher number will likely be better for maintaining a positive state of mind during your job search. Always remember, the choice is yours. <p></p> <b>5. Choose to be humble and hungry.</b> Be humble. Know that you don&#x2019;t have all the answers and can learn something from everyone. Know that there are always new ways to learn, improve, and get better. Be open to advice. Be open to learning a new skill and trying a job you haven&#x2019;t thought of before. Also, be hungry. Seek out a mentor, take him to lunch and model his success. Think of his life as a blueprint you can follow. Continuously improve and seek out new ideas and new strategies. By remaining humble and hungry after my job loss, I was able to focus on and learn the things that made it possible for me to run a restaurant, write and speak. In short, being humble and hungry helped me achieve another great H-word: happiness! <p></p>Now more than ever, fear and uncertainty are becoming staples of daily life. During changing times, it's easy to worry, give up, and let fear paralyze you. However, you have more control than you think you do, and how you handle adversity is your choice&#x2014;the only choice that matters. <p>Many successful people and businesses have grown to prominence during even the worst recessions and downturns. These successful people and organizations all shared similar characteristics and took similar actions to thrive while others merely tried to survive. You can do the same.</p> <p>In <i>The Shark and the Goldfish</i>, bestselling author Jon Gordon shares an inspiring fable about a goldfish who has always been fed, a nice shark who teaches him to find food, and a wave of change that brings them together. In the process of finding food the shark teaches the goldfish the ultimate lesson&#x2014;that the difference between a full belly and an empty stomach depends solely on your faith, beliefs, and actions.</p> <p>In the face of adversity, this is a simple fable that reinforces a proven truth&#x2014;you can't control the events in your life. But you can control how you respond to them. You can allow the waves of change to crush you, or you can learn to ride them to a successful future. Delightfully illustrated and packed with tips and strategies for thriving during tough times, <i>The Shark and the Goldfish</i> is a quick read that will have a lifelong impact.</p></p><h2>Grant&#39;s Atlas of Anatomy, 13th Edition</h2><p>A cornerstone of gross anatomy since 1943, Grant&#39;s Atlas of Anatomy reaches students worldwide with its realistic dissection illustrations, detailed surface anatomy photos, clinical images and comments, and quick-reference muscle tables.

In 1832, the family moved to Cincinnati, where Harriet married Calvin Ellis Stowe, a professor at the seminary, in 1836. The border town of Cincinnati was alive with abolitionist conflict and there Mrs. Stowe took an active part in community life. She came into contact with fugitive slaves, and learned from friends and from personal visits what life was like for the Negro in the South. In 1850, the Fugitive Slave Law was passed, and that same year Harriet&#x2019;s sister-in-law urged the author to put her feelings about the evils of slavery into words. <b>Uncle Tom&#x2019;s Cabin</b> was first published serially during 1851-52 in The National Era, and in book form in 1852. In one year more than 300,000 copies of the novel were sold. Mrs. Stowe continued to write, publishing eleven other novels and numerous articles before her death at the age of eighty-five in Hartford, Connecticut.<p><br><b>Susan K.

Whether or not you think that's a deficit, <i>A History of Mathematics</i> more than makes up for it with its depth and engaging analysis of the development of the "flawless science." Historian Carl B. Boyer designed it as a practical textbook for communicating math's complex timelines to interested college students in 1968; Uta C. Merzbach has gently revised it to bring it in line with current thought. Much of the early chapters are untouched, with new 19th- and 20th-century chapters covering Boyer's omissions and new and revised references guiding the reader to additional resources.<p> From the origins of numbering to the future of computing, the authors strive for comprehensive examination and clear, simple explanations. Some of the math will daunt those who have never taken college-level courses (or have forgotten what they learned), but some of the more elaborate technical material can be skipped if needed. Especially helpful is the extensive timeline-appendix that proceeds from the beginning of time to the late 20th century. Whether you're using it to gain a better understanding of mathematics or to broaden your awareness of the historical record, <i>A History of Mathematics</i> will help you make sense of the wide world of numbers. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>"Boyer and Merzbach distill thousands of years of mathematics into this fascinating chronicle. From the Greeks to Godel, the mathematics is brilliant; the cast of characters is distinguished; the ebb and flow of ideas is everywhere evident. And, while tracing the development of European mathematics, the authors do not overlook the contributions of Chinese, Indian, and Arabic civilizations. Without doubt, this is&#x2014;and will long remain&#x2014;a classic one-volume history of mathematics and mathematicians who create it." &#x2014;William Dunham Author, Journey Through Genius, The Great Theorems of Mathematics "When we read a book like A History of Mathematics, we get the picture of a mounting structure, ever taller and broader and more beautiful and magnificent&#x2014;and with a foundation, moreover, that is as untainted and as functional now as it was when Thales worked out the first geometrical theorems nearly 26 centuries ago." &#x2014;From the Foreword by Isaac Asimov "One of the most useful and comprehensive general introductions to the subject." &#x2014;J.

However, you must be willing to &#x201c;do a new thing.&#x201d; You must spend a little time, each day, in devotion to the truth about yourself and your life. You must make a conscious approach to what you think, what you feel, and what you do. Devotion will clear up misconceptions that may have obscured your vision until today!<br> <br>Bestselling author Iyanla Vanzant presents a new book of devotions for anyone on the path to spiritual empowerment. These daily devotions will create powerful changes in the circumstances of your life that have held you back and will place you on the road to personal strength and peace of mind.</p><p>This book of 365 daily devotionals supports the time-honored adage, "Why put off until tomorrow what you can do today?" The charismatic spiritual leader Iyanla Vanzant knows how easy it is to stay stuck in "old sentiments, resentments, beliefs, decisions, agreements, judgments, and ideas that may have become habitual." Through these devotions Vanzant hopes to show readers that the easiest way to create change is to simply shift your attitude--<i>today</i>. "We often work so hard to get the things we want that we miss the fact that it is the landscape of the inner world that stands between us and true happiness."<p> In the closing paragraph of each one-page devotional Vanzant names an old way of thinking and offers readers a new attitude to try on "just for today." For example, Vanzant writes, "Until today, you may have believed that you had to stay in the painful hole of hurt caused by the loss of a loved one. Just for today, make a conscious effort and choice to cover the hole and move on." Some might consider these devotions a fancy term for affirmations. Vanzant scoffs at the notion. Time spent in devotion is not a "New Age trick through which you can impose your will on God, the universe, or those around you," she writes. "Devotion is the reverent, personal act of surrendering your will to the Divine will." <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>Rev.

He takes refuge in a nearby hotel, along with a disagreeable fellow passenger, who had snored his way through the train journey. But within minutes the other man has snored for the last time - he has been shot dead while sleeping in an armchair. Temperley has a brief encounter with a beautiful young woman, but she flees the scene. When the police arrive, Detective Inspector James discovers a token at the crime scene: a small piece of enamelled metal. Its colour was crimson, and it was in the shape of the letter Z.</p> <p>Temperley sets off in pursuit of the mysterious woman from the hotel, and finds himself embroiled in a cross-country chase - by train and taxi - on the tail of a sinister serial killer. This classic novel by the author of the best-selling <i>Mystery in White</i> is a gripping thriller by a neglected master of the genre.</p></p><p><p><b>J. JEFFERSON FARJEON</b> (1883-1955) was the author of more than sixty crime and thriller novels. His work was highly acclaimed in his day; Dorothy L. Sayers wrote that 'Jefferson Farjeon is quite unsurpassed for creepy skill in mysterious adventures'. Farjeon is now best known as the author of <i>Number Seventeen</i>, a play that was adapted for the big screen by Alfred Hitchcock. His Christmas crime novel, <i>Mystery in White</i>, was republished by the British Library in 2014, with <i>Thirteen Guests</i> and <i>The Z Murders</i> following in 2015.</p>"<i>Thirteen Guests</i>, A British Library Crime Classic by J.

This book shows how your understanding the underlying implementation models can help you code more efficiently and with greater confidence. Lippman dispells the misinformation and myths about the overhead and complexity associated with C++, while pointing out areas in which costs and trade-offs, sometimes hidden, do exist. He then explains how the various implementation models arose, points out areas where they are likely to evolve, and why they are what they are. He covers the semantic implications of the C++ object model and how that model affects you programs.</p><p>Bestselling author Stanley B. Lippman's <i>Inside the C++ Model</i> provides valuable insight into some of the internal workings of the C++ language. This book is a product of a decade of research at Bell Labs (where Lippman worked with C++ inventor Bjarne Stroustrup) and Lippman's considerable C++ expertise. Written with the experienced C++ programmer in mind, this book looks at how key language features are implemented underneath the hood and provides some guidelines when designing C++ classes.<p> This title first examines how C++ objects work--showing the differences between C++ structures and classes. The author looks carefully at the varieties of C++ constructors, including default and copy constructors, data members, and initialization.</p><p> Subsequent sections cover inheritance, including virtual inheritance, and the inner details that will help you create effective and robust data types. The author frequently points out inefficiencies (and efficiencies) that can occur when instantiating objects. The book closes with a tour of more advanced C++ language features, such as templates, exception handling, and run-time type information. This book can help make you the resident C++ language expert at your programming shop. <i>--Richard Dragan</i></p><p>For nearly a decade within Bell Laboratories, I labored at implementing C++. First it was on cfront, Bjarne Stroustrup's original C++ implementation (from Release 1.1 back in 1986 through Release 3.0, made available in September 1991). Then it was on what became known internally as the Simplifier, the C++ Object Model component of the Foundation project. It was during the Simplifier's design period that I conceived of and began working on this book.</p><p>What was the Foundation project? Under Bjarne's leadership, a small group of us within Bell Laboratories was exploring solutions to the problems of large-scale programming using C++. The Foundation was an effort to define a new development model for the construction of large systems (again, using C++ only; we weren't providing a multilingual solution). It was an exciting project, both for the work we were doing and for the people doing the work: Bjarne, Andy Koenig, Rob Murray, Martin Carroll, Judy Ward, Steve Buroff, Peter Juhl, and myself. Barbara Moo was supervising the gang of us other than Bjarne and Andy. Barbara used to say that managing a software group was like herding a pride of cats.</p><p>We thought of the Foundation as a kernel upon which others would layer an actual development environment for users, tailoring it to a UNIX or Smalltalk model as desired. Internally, we called it Grail, as in the quest for, etc. (It seems a Bell Laboratories tradition to mock one's most serious intentions.)</p><p>Grail provided for a persistent, semantic-based representation of the program using an object-oriented hierarchy Rob Murray developed and named ALF. Within Grail, the traditional compiler was factored into separate executables. The parser built up the ALF representation. Each of the other components (type checking, simplification, and code generation) and any tools, such as a browser, operated on (and possibly augmented) a centrally stored ALF representation of the program. The Simplifier is the part of the compiler between type checking and code generation. (Bjarne came up with the name Simplifier; it is a phase of the original cfront implementation.)</p><p>What does a Simplifier do between type checking and code generation? It transforms the internal program representation. There are three general flavors of transformations required by any object model component: Implementation-dependent transformations. These are implementation-specific aspects and vary across compilers. Under ALF, they involved the transformations of what we called "tentative" nodes. For example, when the parser sees the expression<br>fct();it doesn't know if this is (a) an invocation of a function represented or pointed to by fct or (b) the application of an overloaded call operator on a class object fct. By default, the expression is represented as a function call. The Simplifier rewrites and replaces the call subtree when case (b) applies.Language semantics transformations. These include constructor/destructor synthesis and augmentation, memberwise initialization and memberwise copy support, and the insertion within program code of conversion operators, temporaries, and constructor/destructor calls.Code and object model transformations. These include support for virtual functions, virtual base classes and inheritance in general, operators new and delete, arrays of class objects, local static class instances, and the static initialization of global objects with nonconstant expressions. An implementation goal I aimed for in the Simplifier was to provide an Object Model hierarchy in which the object implementation was a virtual interface supporting multiple object models.</p><p>These last two categories of transformations form the basis of this book. Does this mean this book is written for compiler writers? No, absolutely not. It is written by a (former) compiler writer (that's me) for intermediate to advanced C++ programmers (ideally, that's you). The assumption behind this book is that the programmer, by understanding the underlying C++ Object Model, can write programs that are both less error prone and more efficient.What Is the C++ Object Model?</p><p>There are two aspects to the C++ Object Model:The direct support for object-oriented programming provided within the languageThe underlying mechanisms by which this support is implemented</p><p>The language level support is pretty well covered in my C++ Primer and in other books on C++. The second aspect is barely touched on in any current text, with the exception of brief discussions within ELLIS90 and STROUP94. It is this second aspect of the C++ Object Model that is the primary focus of this book. (In that sense, I consider this text to form a bookend to my C++ Primer, much as my MFA and MS degrees provide a "fearful symmetry" to my education.) The language covered within the text is the draft Standard C++ as of the winter 1995 meeting of the committee. (Except for some minor details, this should reflect the final form of the language.)</p><p>The first aspect of the C++ Object Model is invariant. For example, under C++ the complete set of virtual functions available to a class is fixed at compile time; the programmer cannot add to or replace a member of that set dynamically at runtime. This allows for extremely fast dispatch of a virtual invocation, although at the cost of runtime flexibility.</p><p>The underlying mechanisms by which to implement the Object Model are not prescribed by the language, although the semantics of the Object Model itself make some implementations more natural than others. Virtual function calls, for example, are generally resolved through an indexing into a table holding the address of the virtual functions. Must such a virtual table be used? No. An implementation is free to introduce an alternative mechanism. Moreover, if a virtual table is used, its layout, method of access, time of creation, and the other hundred details that must be decided, are all decisions left to each implementation. Having said that, however, I must also say that the general pattern of virtual function implementation across all current compilation systems is to use a class-specific virtual table of a fixed size that is constructed prior to program execution.</p><p>If the underlying mechanisms by which the C++ Object Model is implemented are not standardized, then one might ask, why bother to discuss them at all? The primary reason is because my experience has shown that if a programmer understands the underlying implementation model, the programmer can code more efficiently and with greater confidence. Determining when to provide a copy constructor, and when not, is not something one should guess at or have adjudicated by some language guru. It should come from an understanding of the Object Model.</p><p>A second reason for writing this book is to dispel the various misunderstandings surrounding C++ and its support of object-oriented programming. For example, here is an excerpt from a letter I received from someone wishing to introduce C++ into his programming environment:</p><p>I work with a couple of individuals who have not written and/or are completely unfamiliar with C++ and OO. One of the engineers who has been writing C code since 1985 feels very strongly that C++ is good only for user-type applications, but not server applications. What he is saying is to have a fast and efficient database level engine that it must be written in C compared to C++. He has identified that C++ is bulky and slow.C++, of course, is not inherently bulky and slow, although I've found this to be a common assumption among many C programmers. However, just saying that is not very convincing, particularly if the person saying it is perceived as a C++ partisan. This book is partially an attempt to lay out as precisely as I can the kinds of overhead that are and are not inherent in the various Object facilities such as inheritance, virtual functions, and pointers to class members.</p><p>Rather than answering the individual myself, I forwarded his letter to Steve Vinoski of Hewlett-Packard, with whom I had previously corresponded regarding the efficiency of C++. Here is an excerpt from his response:</p><p>I have heard a number of people over the years voice opinions similar to those of your colleagues. In every case, those opinions could be attributed to a lack of factual knowledge about the C++ language. Just last week I was chatting with an acquaintance who happens to work for an IC testing manufacturer, and he said they don't use C++ because "it does things behind your back." When I pressed him, he said that he understood that C++ calls malloc() and free() without the programmer knowing it. This is of course not true. It is this sort of "myth and legend" that leads to opinions such as those held by your colleagues....</p><p>Finding the right balance between abstraction and pragmatism requires knowledge, experience, and above all, thought. Using C++ well requires effort, but in my experience the returns on the invested effort can be quite high.</p><p>I like to think of this book, then, as my answer to this individual, and, I hope, a repository of knowledge to help put to rest many of the myths and legends surrounding C++.If the underlying mechanisms supporting the C++ Object Model vary both across implementations and over time, how can I possibly provide a general discussion of interest to any particular individual? Static initialization provides an interesting case in point.</p><p>Given a class X with a constructor, such as the following:class X{</p><p>friend istream&amp;</p><p>operator&gt;&gt;( istream&amp;, X&amp; );public:X( int sz = 1024 ) { ptr = new char sz ; }...private:char *ptr;</p><p>};</p><p>and the declaration of a global object of class X, such as the following:X buf;main(){</p><p>// buf must be constructed at this point</p><p>cin &gt;&gt; setw( 1024 ) &gt;&gt; buf;</p><p>...}</p><p>the C++ Object Model guarantees that the X constructor is applied to buf prior to the first user statement of main(). It does not, however, prescribe how that is to get done. The solution is called static initialization; the actual implementation depends on the degree of support provided by the environment.</p><p>The original cfront implementation not only presumed no environment support. It also presumed no explicit platform target. The only presumption was that of being under some variant of UNIX. Our solution, therefore, was specific only to UNIX: the presence of the nm command. The CC command (a UNIX shell script for portability) generated an executable, ran the nm command on the executable--thereby generating a new .c file--compiled the .c file, and then relinked the executable. (This was called the munch solution.) This did the job by trading compile-time efficiency for portability. Eventually, however, users chaffed under the compile-time overhead.</p><p>The next step was to provide a platform-specific solution: a COFF-based program (referred to as the patch solution) that directly examined and threaded the program executable, thus doing away with the need to run nm, compile, and relink. (COFF was the Common Object File Format for System V pre-Release 4 UNIX systems.) Both of these solutions are program-based, that is, within each .c file requiring static initialization cfront generated an sti function to perform the required initializations. Both munch and patch solutions searched for functions bearing an sti prefix and arranged for them to be executed in some undefined order by a _main() library function inserted as the first statement of main().</p><p>In parallel with these releases of cfront, a System V COFF-specific C++ compiler was under development. Targeted for a specific platform and operating system, this compiler was able to effect a change in the System V link editor: a new initialize section that provided for the collection of objects needing static initialization. This extension of the link editor provides what I call an environment-based solution that is certainly superior to a program-based solution.</p><p>So any generalization based on the cfront program-based solution would be misleading. Why? Because as C++ has become a mainstream language, it has received more and more support for environment-based solutions. How is this book to maintain a balance, then? The book's strategy is as follows: If significantly different implementation models exist across C++ compilers, I present a discussion of at least two models. If subsequent implementation models evolved as an attempt to solve perceived problems with the original cfront model, as, for example, with support for virtual inheritance, I present a discussion of the historical evolution. Whenever I speak of the traditional implementation model, I mean, of course, Stroustrup's original design as reflected in cfront and which has provided a pattern of implementation that can still be seen today in all commercial implementations, even if only as a "reaction against."Organization of This Book</p><p>Chapter 1, Object Lessons, provides background on the object-based and object-oriented programming paradigms supported by C++. It includes a brief tour of the Object Model, illustrating the current prevailing industry implementation without looking too closely at multiple or virtual inheritance. (This is fleshed out in Chapters 3 and 4.)</p><p>Chapter 2, The Semantics of Constructors, discusses in detail how constructors work. It discusses when constructors are synthesized by the compiler and what that means in practical terms for your program's performance.</p><p>Chapters 3 through 5 contain the primary material of the book. There, the details of the C++ Object Model are discussed. Chapter 3, The Semantics of Data, looks at the handling of data members. Chapter 4, The Semantics of Function, focuses on the varieties of member functions, with a detailed look at virtual function support. Chapter 5, Semantics of Construction, Destruction, and Copy, deals with support of the class model and object lifetime. Program test data is discussed within each of these chapters, where our performance expectations are compared against actual performance as the representations move from an object-based to object-oriented solution.</p><p>Chapter 6, Runtime Semantics, looks at some of the Object Model behavior at runtime, including the life and death of temporary objects and the support of operators new and delete. </p><p>Chapter 7, On the Cusp of the Object Model, focuses on exception handling, template support, and runtime type identification.The Intended Audience</p><p>This book is primarily a tutorial, although it is aimed at the intermediate C++ programmer rather than the novice. I have attempted to provide sufficient context to make it understandable to anyone who has had some prior exposure to C++--for example, someone who has read my C++ Primer--and some experience in C++ programming. The ideal reader, however, has been programming in C++ for a few years and wants to better understand what is actually going on "under the hood." Portions of the material should be of interest even to the advanced C++ programmer, such as the generation of temporaries and the details of the named return value optimization. At least, this has proved to be so in the various public presentations of this material I have given as it has evolved.A Note on Program Examples and Program Execution</p><p>The use of program code in this text ser...</p></p><h2>More Innovative Redesign and Reorganization of Library Technical Services</h2><p><p>This book follows the author's successful <i>Innovative Redesigns</i> and <i>Reorganizations of Library Technical Services</i>, with even more case studies and surveys.

For years, scientists have looked, with little success, to astronomical records for an explanation of the magical star that guided the Magi to Christ&#x2019;s manger. Intrigued by the image he found on the latest addition to his coin collection, Michael Molnar thought there might be more to learn by looking, instead, at the teachings of ancient astrologers.</p><p>Molnar argues in his book that the Star of Bethlehem was not a star at all, but rather a regal portent centering around the planet Jupiter that was eclipsed by the moon. He bases this theory on the actual beliefs of astrologers, such as the Magi, who lived around the time of Christ. Molnar found some intriguing clues to the mystery while researching the meaning of astrological symbols he found an ancient coin, which bore the image of Aries looking back at a star. He found that Aries was a symbol of Judea at the time, and that ancient astrologers believed that a new king would be born when the moon passed in front of Jupiter. Molnar wondered, could the coin have been issued as a response to the Great Messianic Portent, the Star of Bethlehem?</p><p>To match the story of the appearance of the Christmas star, Molnar also knew the event had to happen when Jupiter was &#x201c;in the east.&#x201d; Using these criteria and a computer program, he was able to chart an eclipse of Jupiter in Aries on April 17, 6 B.C., a day when Jupiter was precisely &#x201c;in the east,&#x201d; which confirmed his theory. Moreover, he found that a Roman astrologer described the conditions of that day as fitting the birth of a &#x201c;divine and immortal&#x201d; person.</p><p>According to Harvard University Professor Owen Gingerich, &#x201c;this is the most original and important contribution of the entire 20th century&#x201d; about the Magi&#x2019;s star. Using clues from astronomy, astrology, and history, Molnar has created a provocative, fascinating theory on the Christmas Star. He weaves together an intriguing scientific detective story which resolves one of the world&#x2019;s greatest mysteries: The Star of Bethlehem at the birth of Christ.</p></p><p>Could the fifty-dollar purchase of an ancient coin by a Rutgers astronomer have unlocked the mystery of the Christmas star? For two millennia, scientist have searched the heavens in vain for an astronomical explanation of the Star of Bethlehem. Intrigued by the image of a ram looking back at a star that he found on the latest addition to his coin collection, Michael Molnar thought there might be more to learn by looking, instead, at the theories of ancient astrologers. <p>Aries the ram looking back at the stars, he argues, is connected to astrological beliefs of the Magi, the Three Wise Men, and has much to tell us about this regal portent. At the time of Christ's birth, Aries was a symbol of Judea. Ancient astrologers, such as the Magi, believed that a new king would be born when the moon passed in front of Jupiter-an eclipse that would herald the Messiah's coming. Could the coin have been issued as a response to the Great Messianic Portent, the Star of Bethlehem? </p><p>Molnar combined his training in astronomy with his knowledge of astrology and deduced that the Star of Bethlehem could have appeared only when Jupiter was "in the East." Modern-day computer wizardry enabled him to chart an eclipse of Jupiter in Aries on April, 6 B.C. a day when Jupiter was, in fact, in the east, thus confirming his theory. The hypothesis was supported by additional findings as well. A Roman astrologer, he found, had described the conditions of the day as those befitting the birth of a "divine and immortal" person. </p><p>Molnar has woven together an intriguing scientific detective story using astronomical, astrological, and historical clues to resolve one of the world's greatest mysteries: What led the Magi to Bethlehem?</p>What did the Magi actually see?

Remarkably, the three main pyramids at Giza in Egypt, including the Great Pyramid, align with the same three stars. But where did this ancient veneration of Cygnus come from? <br><br>Showing that Cygnus was once seen as a portal to the sky-world, Andrew Collins reveals how, at both sites, the attention toward this star group is linked with sound acoustics and the use of musical intervals &#x201c;discovered&#x201d; thousands of years later by the Greek mathematician Pythagoras. Collins traces these ideas as well as early advances in human technology and cosmology back to the Altai-Baikal region of Russian Siberia, where the cult of the swan flourished as much as 20,000 years ago. He shows how these concepts, including a complex numeric system based on long-term eclipse cycles, are derived from an extinct human population known as the Denisovans. Not only were they of exceptional size--the ancient giants of myth--but archaeological discoveries show that this previously unrecognized human population achieved an advanced level of culture, including the use of high-speed drilling techniques and the creation of musical instruments. <br><br>The author explains how the stars of Cygnus coincided with the turning point of the heavens at the moment the Denisovan legacy was handed to the first human societies in southern Siberia 45,000 years ago, catalyzing beliefs in swan ancestry and an understanding of Cygnus as the source of cosmic creation. It also led to powerful ideas involving the Milky Way&#x2019;s Dark Rift, viewed as the Path of Souls and the sky-road shamans travel to reach the sky-world. He explores how their sound technology and ancient cosmologies were carried into the West, flowering first at G�bekli Tepe and then later in Egypt&#x2019;s Nile Valley. Collins shows how the ancient belief in Cygnus as the source of creation can also be found in many other cultures around the world, further confirming the role played by the Denisovan legacy in the genesis of human civilization.</p><p>Andrew Collins is a science and history writer, who has been investigating the origins of human civilization for over three decades. He is a noted explorer and the co-discoverer of a massive cave complex beneath the Giza plateau, now known as &#x201c;Collins&#x2019; Caves.&#x201d; He is the author of several bestselling books, including <i>From the Ashes of Angels</i> and <i>Gobekli Tepe: Genesis of the Gods</i>.

As to their function, Schmidt proposed they were <i>seelenloch</i>, a word in his native German language meaning &#x201c;soul hole.&#x201d; So what exactly are soul holes?<br><br><b>Form and Function</b> <br><br>A large number of megalithic (that is, large stone) chambered tombs, or dolmens, from Ireland in the west to India in the east, have circular apertures cut into their entrance facades. Like the porthole stones at G�bekli Tepe, these bored holes are usually between 25 and 40 centimeters (10 to 16 inches) in diameter: too small for a grown person to pass through bodily. The porthole stones seen in Neolithic and later Bronze Age dolmens, which generally date to circa 3000&#x2013;2000 BCE, could have functioned as a means of offering food and gifts to the spirits of human remains interred within the structures. Alternately, the apertures might have enabled further burials to be added, or, indeed, original interments to be removed.<br><br>Such ideas, however, are inadequate to fully explain the widespread use of circular apertures in a funerary context. For example, in India circular apertures appear in stone slabs used as entrances to cist burials, which were generally sealed beneath the earth following construction. Deliberately bored holes are seen also in ceramic urn jars found in cemeteries across Europe and Southwest Asia. These date to the Iron Age and later Roman times. The purpose of these holes was to provide a means for the release of the soul, the presence of dirt, or any other constrictions not being seen as a hindrance to the soul&#x2019;s ability to leave its place of interment.<br><br>In a like manner, small doors or windows known as <i>armen seelenloch</i>, &#x201c;poor soul holes,&#x201d; were once incorporated into the walls of houses in the Austrian Tyrol. A number survive today, and there seems little question that their primary function was to allow the exit of a soul following death since these miniature doors were opened only when a death occurred in the household. The function of <i>armen seelenloch</i> has been linked with the porthole stones of megalithic monuments located in the same region, suggesting a continuity of ideas from the Neolithic age through to the present day. <br><br>Almost certainly connected to the function of <i>armen seelenloch</i> is the fact that members of the Ojibway tribe, indigenous peoples of Canada and the northern United States, would bore a hole in a coffin so as &#x201c;to let the soul go out and in at pleasure.&#x201d; In a similar manner, hospital nurses in southern England upon the death of a patient would open the window nearest to the feet of a body so that the soul might escape. Very likely at least some of the porthole stones at G�bekli Tepe served a similar function, although instead of the exiting souls being used by the deceased, it was the soul or spirit of the shaman or entrant that was thought to exit this world using these circular apertures.<br><br><b>Shamanistic Practices</b> <br><br>Shamanistic practices in various parts of the world incorporate the use of a symbolic hole, either in a rock, in the ground, in a tree, or in the roof of a yurt or tent. Their presence enables the spirit of the shaman to leave its physical environment and enter invisible realms described in terms as the Upper and Lower World. The Upper World was thought to exist in the sky; the Lower World beneath the earth.<br><br>In addition to this, Siberian shamans are known to have employed the use of bones with holes at their center to begin to &#x201c;see all, and to know all&#x201d; and that this &#x201c;is when one becomes a shaman.&#x201d; In other words, pierced bones were used in ritual practices that involved the participant achieving an ecstatic or altered state of consciousness and then projecting his or her mind through the hole to enter unseen realms. Here they would attain otherworldly knowledge and enlightenment not normally accessible to those inhabiting the land of the living.<br><br>So the presence of the pecked hole between the twin pillars seen on the carved bone plaque found at G�bekli Tepe indicates that during rites and ceremonies a person entering the site&#x2019;s enclosures approached between the twin central monoliths and focused their eyes on the porthole stone. Very likely these holed stones formed a bridge, portal, or point of connection between the liminal realm created by the enclosure&#x2019;s circular interiors and otherworldly environments thought to exist beyond the physical plane of existence.<br><br>This was an important realization for it helped confirm the axial orientation of Enclosures C and D, which in both cases was toward the north-northwest, where both portholes stones are to be found. Yet why were both the twin central pillars and the holed stones oriented toward the north-northwest?<br><br>Was there something of importance in this direction? The answer to this question is, of course, yes. In the minds of those responsible for both the creation of the megalithic enclosures at G�bekli Tepe and the execution of the tiny bone plaque found at the site there was something of extreme importance in this direction, and this was the stars of the night sky.</p><h2>Big History: Examines Our Past, Explains Our Present, Imagines Our Future</h2><p><p>Featuring a foreword by the father of Big History, David Christian, and produced in association with the Big History Institute, <i>Big History</i> provides a comprehensive understanding of the major events that have changed the nature and course of life on the planet we call home.

With minimal text and 300 pages of infographics, this is an amuse-bouche of history: just a bite of information that whets the appetite but does not satisfy. Created in consultation with directors and educational leaders at the Big History Institute at Macquarie University in Sydney, this title takes a broad, interdisciplinary approach to history through brief, pithy entries on a wide range of connected subjects. The layout is very similar to the entries in DK's "Eyewitness" books. The work is divided into eight "thresholds" that cover astronomy; the formation of planets and solar systems; the emergence of life and humans, civilization, and industrialization. Also included are a series of time lines. This is a great introductory text on life, the universe, and everything. Unfortunately, unlike an encyclopedia, this selection will not lead readers to other sources that will give them a deeper appreciation of the subjects covered. VERDICT Though this isn't ideal for report writers, it's an engaging offering for browsers looking for a visually engaging overview of history.&#x2014;Susanne Caro, University of Montana Library, Missoula</p><h2>The Wealth of Nations: The Economics Classic - A Selected Edition for the Contemporary Reader</h2><p>Published in 1778, <b>The Wealth of Nations</b> was the first book on economics to catch the public's attention.

Determined to find the treasure of the notorious pirate Red Rackham, Tintin and Captain Haddock set sail aboard the Sirius to find the shipwreck of the Unicorn. With the help of an ingenious shark-shaped submarine, Tintin follows the clues deep down on this ocean adventure. Join the most iconic character in comics as he embarks on an extraordinary adventure spanning historical and political events, and thrilling mysteries. Still selling over 100,000 copies every year in the UK and having been adapted for the silver screen by Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson in 2011. The Adventures of Tintin continue to charm more than 80 years after they first found their way into publication. Since then an estimated 230 million copies have been sold, proving that comic books have the same power to entertain children and adults in the 21st century as they did in the early 20th.</p><p>Concluding the story begun in <i>The Secret of the Unicorn</i>, <i>Red Rackham's Treasure</i> follows Tintin and friends as they search for the pirate booty procured by Captain Haddock's ancestor, Sir Francis Haddock, in the West Indies. They receive some unexpected help in the form of a hard-of-hearing inventor named Professor Calculus, who would go on to become one of the most endearing characters of the series. (Herge admitted that the character was one "whom I never suspected would take on such importance.") It's a lot of fun, with some submarine and diving adventures, humor from the Thompsons, and an unexpected (but satisfying) ending. <i>--David Horiuchi</i>Herge (Georges Remi) was born in Brussels in 1907. Over the course of 54 years he completed 23 albums of The Adventures of Tintin series, which is now considered to be one of the greatest, if not the greatest, comics series of all time. With translations published in over 80 languages, more than 230 million copies sold worldwide and a Hollywood movie to its name, Tintin dominates the Comics and Graphic Novels chart even today. Sadly, Herge died in 1983, leaving his 24th album, Tintin and Alph-Art, unfinished, but his hero continues to be one of the most iconic characters in both adult and children&#39;s fiction.</p><h2>Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries: Development and history</h2><p>Shelf and edge wear.

Adapted many times to the screen and stage, and the inspiration for numerous imitations, it remains today her most widely read book. Now, in this beautifully illustrated and annotated edition, distinguished scholar <b>Patricia Meyer Spacks</b> instructs the reader in a larger appreciation of the novel&#x2019;s enduring pleasures and provides analysis of Darcy, Elizabeth Bennet, Lady Catherine, and all the characters who inhabit the world of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>. </p><p>This edition will be treasured by specialists and first-time readers, and especially by devoted Austen fans who think of themselves as Friends of Jane. In her Introduction, Spacks considers Austen&#x2019;s life and career, the continuing appeal of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>, and its power as a stimulus for fantasy (Maureen Dowd, writing in <i>The New York Times</i>, can hold forth at length on Obama as a Darcy-figure, knowing full well her readers will &#x201c;understand that she wished to suggest glamour and sexiness&#x201d;). Her Introduction also explores the value and art of literary annotation.

Together with the Bill of Rights and the Civil War amendments, these documents constitute what James Madison called our &#x201c;political scriptures&#x201d; and have come to define us as a people. Now a Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning historian serves as a guide to these texts, providing historical contexts and offering interpretive commentary. </p><p>In an introductory essay written for the general reader, Jack N. Rakove provides a narrative political account of how these documents came to be written. In his commentary on the Declaration of Independence, Rakove sets the historical context for a fuller appreciation of the important preamble and the list of charges leveled against the Crown. When he glosses the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the subsequent amendments, Rakove once again provides helpful historical background, targets language that has proven particularly difficult or controversial, and cites leading Supreme Court cases. A chronology of events provides a framework for understanding the road to Philadelphia. The general reader will not find a better, more helpful guide to our founding documents than Jack N. Rakove.</p></p><p>Jack N. Rakove is the William R. Coe Professor of History and American Studies and Professor of Political Science at Stanford University and author of the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning Original Meanings: Politics and Ideas in the Making of the Constitution.Jack Rakove is one of the most distinguished historians of this nation's Founding era. Here, he explores the background of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution and explicates their meaning. Every American citizen wishing to know more about our founding documents will find this book an invaluable introduction to our distinctive legal heritage. (Michael J. Klarman, Kirkland &amp; Ellis Professor, Harvard Law School)<br><br>Jack Rakove provides clear and accessible annotations to the two most fundamental documents of America's civil religion. Especially important are his insights about 'hard-wired' constitutional provisions that, because they are never litigated, are too often ignored with regard to their role in structuring the American polity. This book will prove of immense value to students, scholars, and ordinary citizens. (Sanford Levinson, author of <i>Our Undemocratic Constitution: Where the Constitution Goes Wrong (and How We the People Can Correct It)</i>)<br><br>[A] probing commentary on America's founding documents...Rakove's is a lucid, thought-provoking guide to the contents--and discontents--of our national charters. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2009-09-14)<br><br>[A] carefully laid out annotation that's accessible to general readers as well as high school and college students. [Rakove's] extended introduction provides a readable and instructive analysis of how the writing of the Constitution progressed, especially on matters concerning representation, executive power, and creation of the amendments. His annotations often rely upon contemporary usage and meaning from the time of the Declaration of Independence and Constitution--useful for students to understand--and he compares such usage to other documents of the time...Highly recommended for general readers and undergraduates who want an initial understanding of the Declaration and Constitution. (Steven Puro <i>Library Journal</i> 2009-10-15)<br><br>With more decisions to come on the heels of the U.S. Supreme Court's redefinition of campaign--finance law in the context of the First Amendment, [this book is a] timely reminder that Americans too rarely read, much less consider, their nation's most important documents as closely as they should...[It's an] important addition to a vital and ongoing American debate. Whatever one thinks the Constitution and Declaration of Independence mean, there's value in revisiting those texts, reviewing how they've been construed throughout U.S. history and reconsidering arguments for and against differing interpretations. [This book] invites Americans to do just that--and to renew their appreciation for the genius of those who drafted the blueprints for U.S. freedom and republican government. (Alan Wallace <i>Pittsburgh Tribune-Review</i> 2010-01-31)<br><br>Provide[s] some essential civic education...Rakove's inclusion of (and comments on) the Declaration of Independence is useful, and his extensive introduction is especially valuable. Rakove is one of the most gifted writers among contemporary American historians, and he provides an illuminating overview of the political history that generated both the Declaration in 1776 and then, only eleven years later (following the failure of our first constitution, the Articles of Confederation), the Constitution that was drafted in Philadelphia. (Sanford Levinson <i>New Republic online</i> 2010-02-23)<br><br>Unlike many of his contemporaries, [Rakove] breathes life into the two founding documents of the U.S., and arguably into the ideals and beliefs that define America and Americanism. This volume gives students, scholars, practitioners, and general readers an insightful, easily understood, and well-researched narrative political account of how these documents came to be written. Rakove places the colorful personalities of the founding fathers, along with the concepts, issues, and concerns involved with these documents, within an easily discernable context. His attention to historical and political detail is unwavering and on target. Indeed he puts the fun back into reading and learning about the U.S.'s two most important documents. (W.

Revolution in the Valley traces this vision back to its earliest roots: the hallways and backrooms of Apple, where the groundbreaking Macintosh computer was born. The book traces the development of the Macintosh, from its inception as an underground skunkworks project in 1979 to its triumphant introduction in 1984 and beyond.<br><br>The stories in <i>Revolution in the Valley</i> come on extremely good authority. That's because author Andy Hertzfeld was a core member of the team that built the Macintosh system software, and a key creator of the Mac's radically new user interface software. One of the chosen few who worked with the mercurial Steve Jobs, you might call him the ultimate insider.<br><br>When <i>Revolution in the Valley</i> begins, Hertzfeld is working on Apple's first attempt at a low-cost, consumer-oriented computer: the Apple II. He sees that Steve Jobs is luring some of the company's most brilliant innovators to work on a tiny research effort the Macintosh. Hertzfeld manages to make his way onto the Macintosh research team, and the rest is history.<br><br>Through lavish illustrations, period photos, and Hertzfeld's vivid first-hand accounts, Revolution in the Valley reveals what it was like to be there at the birth of the personal computer revolution. The story comes to life through the book's portrait of the talented and often eccentric characters who made up the Macintosh team. Now, over 20 years later, millions of people are benefiting from the technical achievements of this determined and brilliant group of people.</p></p><p><p>Andy Hertzfeld was a graduate student in computer science at UC Berkeley in January 1978 when he purchased one of the first Apple IIs.He quickly lost interest in grad school as he began writing programs for his Apple II, eventually leading him to join Apple Computer as a systems programmer in August 1979. He joined the Macintosh team in February 1981, and became one of the main authors of the Macintosh system software, including the User Interface Toolbox and many of the original desk accessories. He left Apple in March 1984, and went on to co-found three companies: Radius (1986), General Magic (1990) and Eazel (1999). In 2003, he developed web-based software for collective storytelling that he used to write the stories in this book. In 2005, he joined Google, and was one of the main creators of Google+.</p>Another blog-turned-book (see Hertzfeld's www.folklore.org), this set of remembrances chronicles the birth of the Macintosh from inside the lab. In 1978, Hertzfeld's world was rocked by his purchase of an Apple II; by the next year, he was working for the fledgling company on the nascent Mac as a software engineer, co-writing the Mac's operating system. Strictly for Silicon Valley-folk and Apple obsessives, Hertzfeld's short entries dwell on everything from mouse-scaling parameters to the eating habits of hardware engineer Burrell Smith. A plethora of color photos feature early screen shots and sedentary-looking Mac team members in tight t-shirts ("User Friendly!") and large glasses. Even aficionados may find their attention wandering at sentences like, "The most controversial part of the Control Panel was the desktop pattern editor, which I had rescued from its earlier standalone incarnation." But among the 90 entries, highlights include awkward-looking early demos of the Mac's operating system; competition and idea-swapping with Microsoft, Osborne and Xerox; and inside glimpses of Apple's unique, before-the-boom culture. Hertzfeld's earnest enthusiasm for the work that he and the team began 25-plus years ago is infectious enough to carry one through the rest. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As it has returned to life, it has pursued a vision of reclaiming Holy Rus&#x2019;: that historical yet mythical homeland of the eastern Slavic peoples; a foretaste of the perfect justice, peace, harmony, and beauty for which religious believers long; and the glimpse of heaven on earth that persuaded Prince Vladimir to accept Orthodox baptism in Crimea in A.D. 988.<br><br> Through groundbreaking initiatives in religious education, social ministry, historical commemoration, and parish life, the Orthodox Church is seeking to shape a new, post-communist national identity for Russia.

Violence is ubiquitous and incessant but protean, varying its outward form according to the social constellation at hand. In <i>Topology of Violence</i>, the philosopher Byung-Chul Han considers the shift in violence from the visible to the invisible, from the frontal to the viral to the self-inflicted, from brute force to mediated force, from the real to the virtual. Violence, Han tells us, has gone from the negative&#x2015;explosive, massive, and martial&#x2015;to the positive, wielded without enmity or domination. This, he says, creates the false impression that violence has disappeared. Anonymized, desubjectified, systemic, violence conceals itself because it has become one with society. </p><p>Han first investigates the <i>macro-physical</i> manifestations of violence, which take the form of negativity&#x2015;developing from the tension between self and other, interior and exterior, friend and enemy. These manifestations include the archaic violence of sacrifice and blood, the mythical violence of jealous and vengeful gods, the deadly violence of the sovereign, the merciless violence of torture, the bloodless violence of the gas chamber, the viral violence of terrorism, and the verbal violence of hurtful language. He then examines the violence of positivity&#x2015;the expression of an excess of positivity&#x2015;which manifests itself as over-achievement, over-production, over-communication, hyper-attention, and hyperactivity. The violence of positivity, Han warns, could be even more disastrous than that of negativity. Infection, invasion, and infiltration have given way to infarction.</p></p><p>Byung-Chul Han, born in Seoul, is Professor of Philosophy and Cultural Studies at the Universit�t der K�nste Berlin (UdK).

His dream was at times characterized as a benevolent interest in the brotherhood of man, sometimes as a brute interest in the exercise of power. Green, a Cambridge-trained classicist who is also a novelist, portrays Alexander as both a complex personality and a single-minded general, a man capable of such diverse expediencies as patricide or the massacre of civilians. Green describes his Alexander as "not only the most brilliant (and ambitious) field commander in history, but also supremely indifferent to all those administrative excellences and idealistic yearnings foisted upon him by later generations, especially those who found the conqueror, tout court, a little hard upon their liberal sensibilities."<br><br>This biography begins not with one of the universally known incidents of Alexander's life, but with an account of his father, Philip of Macedonia, whose many-territoried empire was the first on the continent of Europe to have an effectively centralized government and military. What Philip and Macedonia had to offer, Alexander made his own, but Philip and Macedonia also made Alexander form an important context for understanding Alexander himself. Yet his origins and training do not fully explain the man. After he was named hegemon of the Hellenic League, many philosophers came to congratulate Alexander, but one was conspicuous by his absence: Diogenes the Cynic, an ascetic who lived in a clay tub. Piqued and curious, Alexander himself visited the philosopher, who, when asked if there was anything Alexander could do for him, made the famous reply, "Don't stand between me and the sun." Alexander's courtiers jeered, but Alexander silenced them: "If I were not Alexander, I would be Diogenes." This remark was as unexpected in Alexander as it would be in a modern leader.<br><br>For the general reader, the book, redolent with gritty details and fully aware of Alexander's darker side, offers a gripping tale of Alexander's career. Full backnotes, fourteen maps, and chronological and genealogical tables serve readers with more specialized interests.</p><p>There's no shortage of biographies available on Alexander the Great, but Peter Green's <i>Alexander of Macedon</i> is one of the finest. The prose is crisp and clear, and within a few pages readers become absorbed in the world that made Alexander, and then the story of how Alexander remade it. Green writes, "Alexander's true genius was as a field-commander: perhaps, taken all in all, the most incomparable general the world has ever seen. His gift for speed, improvisation, variety of strategy; his cool-headedness in a crisis; his ability to extract himself from the most impossible situations; his mastery of terrain; his psychological ability to penetrate the enemy's intentions--all these qualities place him at the very head of the Great Captains of history."<b>Peter Green</b> is Dougherty Centennial Professor of Classics at the University of Texas at Austin and the author of <i>Alexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Hellenistic Age</i> (California, 1990).</p><h2>An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding (Oxford Philosophical Texts)</h2><p>The Oxford Philosophical Texts series consists of truly practical and accessible guides to major philosophical texts in the history of philosophy from the ancient world up to modern times. Each book opens with a comprehensive introduction by a leading specialist which covers the philosopher's life, work, and influence. Endnotes, a full bibliography, guides to further reading, and an index are also included. The series aims to build a definitive corpus of key texts in the Western philosophical tradition, forming a reliable and enduring resource for students and teachers alike. <br> Now one of the most widely read works in philosophy, David Hume's <em>An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding</em> (1748) introduced his philosophy to a broad educated readership. In it he gives an elegant an accessible presentation of strikingly original and challenging views about the limited powers of human understanding, the attractions of skepticism, the compatibility of free will and determinism, and weaknesses in the foundations of religion. In this volume, an authoritative new version of the text is enhanced by detailed explanatory notes, a glossary of terms, a full list of references, and a section of supplementary readings.<br></p><p>Library of Liberal Arts title.David Hume (1711-1776) was a Scottish philosopher, economist, and historian, as well as an important figure of Western philosophy and of the Scottish Enlightenment.

A footpath wound its way gently down the sloping land till it reached the broad river bottom; creeping through the long swamp grasses that bent over it on either side, it came out on the edge of the Missouri.</p><p>Here, morning, noon, and evening, my mother came to draw water from the muddy stream for our household use. Always, when my mother started for the river, I stopped my play to run along with her. She was only of medium height. Often she was sad and silent, at which times her full arched lips were compressed into hard and bitter lines, and shadows fell under her black eyes. Then I clung to her hand and begged to know what made the tears fall.</p><p>&#x201c;Hush; my little daughter must never talk about my tears&#x201d;; and smiling through them, she patted my head and said, &#x201c;Now let me see how fast you can run today.&#x201d; Whereupon I tore away at my highest possible speed, with my long black hair blowing in the breeze.</p><p>I was a wild little girl of seven. Loosely clad in a slip of brown buckskin, and light-�footed with a pair of soft moccasins on my feet, I was as free as the wind that blew my hair, and no less spirited than a bounding deer. These were my mother&#x2019;s pride,&#x2014;�my wild freedom and overflowing spirits. She taught me no fear save that of intruding myself upon others.</p><p>Having gone many paces ahead I stopped, panting for breath, and laughing with glee as my mother watched my every movement. I was not wholly conscious of myself, but was more keenly alive to the fire within. It was as if I were the activity, and my hands and feet were only experiments for my spirit to work upon.</p><p>Returning from the river, I tugged beside my mother, with my hand upon the bucket I believed I was carrying. One time, on such a return, I remember a bit of conversation we had. My grown-�up cousin, Warca-�Ziwin (Sunflower), who was then seventeen, always went to the river alone for water for her mother. Their wigwam was not far from ours; and I saw her daily going to and from the river. I admired my cousin greatly. So I said: &#x201c;Mother, when I am tall as my cousin Warca-�Ziwin, you shall not have to come for water. I will do it for you.&#x201d;</p><p>With a strange tremor in her voice which I could not understand, she answered, &#x201c;If the paleface does not take away from us the river we drink.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mother, who is this bad paleface?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;My little daughter, he is a sham,&#x2014;�a sickly sham! The bronzed Dakota is the only real man.&#x201d;</p><p>I looked up into my mother&#x2019;s face while she spoke; and seeing her bite her lips, I knew she was unhappy. This aroused revenge in my small soul. Stamping my foot on the earth, I cried aloud, &#x201c;I hate the paleface that makes my mother cry!&#x201d;<br><br>Setting the pail of water on the ground, my mother stooped, and stretching her left hand out on the level with my eyes, she placed her other arm about me; she pointed to the hill where my uncle and my only sister lay buried.</p><p>&#x201c;There is what the paleface has done! Since then your father too has been buried in a hill nearer the rising sun. We were once very happy. But the paleface has stolen our lands and driven us hither. Having defrauded us of our land, the paleface forced us away.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, it happened on the day we moved camp that your sister and uncle were both very sick. Many others were ailing, but there seemed to be no help. We traveled many days and nights; not in the grand, happy way that we moved camp when I was a little girl, but we were driven, my child, driven like a herd of buffalo. With every step, your sister, who was not as large as you are now, shrieked with the painful jar until she was hoarse with crying. She grew more and more feverish. Her little hands and cheeks were burning hot. Her little lips were parched and dry, but she would not drink the water I gave her. Then I discovered that her throat was swollen and red. My poor child, how I cried with her because the Great Spirit had forgotten us!</p><p>&#x201c;At last, when we reached this western country, on the first weary night your sister died. And soon your uncle died also, leaving a widow and an orphan daughter, your cousin Warca-�Ziwin. Both your sister and uncle might have been happy with us today, had it not been for the heartless paleface.&#x201d;</p><p>My mother was silent the rest of the way to our wigwam. Though I saw no tears in her eyes, I knew that was because I was with her. She seldom wept before me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>II</p><p>THE LEGENDS</p><p>During the summer days my mother built her fire in the shadow of our wigwam.</p><p>In the early morning our simple breakfast was spread upon the grass west of our tepee. At the farthest point of the shade my mother sat beside her fire, toasting a savory piece of dried meat. Near her, I sat upon my feet, eating my dried meat with unleavened bread, and drinking strong black coffee.</p><p>The morning meal was our quiet hour, when we two were entirely alone. At noon, several who chanced to be passing by stopped to rest, and to share our luncheon with us, for they were sure of our hospitality.</p><p>My uncle, whose death my mother ever lamented, was one of our nation&#x2019;s bravest warriors. His name was on the lips of old men when talking of the proud feats of valor; and it was mentioned by younger men, too, in connection with deeds of gallantry. Old women praised him for his kindness toward them; young women held him up as an ideal to their sweet-�hearts. Every one loved him, and my mother worshiped his memory. Thus it happened that even strangers were sure of welcome in our lodge, if they but asked a favor in my uncle&#x2019;s name.</p><p>Though I heard many strange experiences related by these wayfarers, I loved best the evening meal, for that was the time old legends were told. I was always glad when the sun hung low in the west, for then my mother sent me to invite the neighboring old men and women to eat supper with us. Running all the way to the wigwams, I halted shyly at the entrances. Sometimes I stood long moments without saying a word. It was not any fear that made me so dumb when out upon such a happy errand; nor was it that I wished to withhold the invitation, for it was all I could do to observe this very proper silence. But it was a sensing of the atmosphere, to assure myself that I should not hinder other plans. My mother used to say to me, as I was almost bounding away for the old people: &#x201c;Wait a moment before you invite any one. If other plans are being discussed, do not interfere, but go elsewhere.&#x201d;</p><p>The old folks knew the meaning of my pauses; and often they coaxed my confidence by asking, &#x201c;What do you seek, little granddaughter?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My mother says you are to come to our tepee this evening,&#x201d; I instantly exploded, and breathed the freer afterwards.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, yes, gladly, gladly I shall come!&#x201d; each replied. Rising at once and carrying their blankets across one shoulder, they flocked leisurely from their various wigwams toward our dwelling.</p><p>My mission done, I ran back, skipping and jumping with delight. All out of breath, I told my mother almost the exact words of the answers to my invitation. Frequently she asked, &#x201c;What were they doing when you entered their tepee?&#x201d; This taught me to remember all I saw at a single glance. Often I told my mother my impressions without being questioned.</p><p>While in the neighboring wigwams sometimes an old Indian woman asked me, &#x201c;What is your mother doing?&#x201d; Unless my mother had cautioned me not to tell, I generally answered her questions without reserve.</p><p>At the arrival of our guests I sat close to my mother, and did not leave her side without first asking her consent. I ate my supper in quiet, listening patiently to the talk of the old people, wishing all the time that they would begin the stories I loved best. At last, when I could not wait any longer, I whispered in my mother&#x2019;s ear, &#x201c;Ask them to tell an Iktomi story, mother.&#x201d;</p><p>Soothing my impatience, my mother said aloud, &#x201c;My little daughter is anxious to hear your legends.&#x201d; By this time all were through eating, and the evening was fast deepening into twilight.</p><p>As each in turn began to tell a legend, I pillowed my head in my mother&#x2019;s lap; and lying flat upon my back, I watched the stars as they peeped down upon me, one by one. The increasing interest of the tale aroused me, and I sat up eagerly listening to every word. The old women made funny remarks, and laughed so heartily that I could not help joining them.</p></p><h2>College Study Skills: Becoming a Strategic Learner</h2><p>COLLEGE STUDY SKILLS: BECOMING A STRATEGIC LEARNER, Seventh Edition, is a wide-ranging, practical text that focuses on helping you become actively engaged in your own learning.

It is a book about houses and about culture and about how each affects the other, and it must stand as one of the major works on the history of modern housing." - Paul Goldberger, The New York Times Book Review</b></p><p>Long before Betty Friedan wrote about "the problem that had no name" in The Feminine Mystique, a group of American feminists whose leaders included Melusina Fay Peirce, Mary Livermore, and Charlotte Perkins Gilman campaigned against women's isolation in the home and confinement to domestic life as the basic cause of their unequal position in society.<i>The Grand Domestic Revolution</i> reveals the innovative plans and visionary strategies of these persistent women, who developed the theory and practice of what Hayden calls "material feminism" in pursuit of economic independence and social equality. The material feminists' ambitious goals of socialized housework and child care meant revolutionizing the American home and creating community services. They raised fundamental questions about the relationship of men, women, and children in industrial society. Hayden analyzes the utopian and pragmatic sources of the feminists' programs for domestic reorganization and the conflicts over class, race, and gender they encountered. This history of a little-known intellectual tradition challenging patriarchal notions of "women's place" and "women's work" offers a new interpretation of the history of American feminism and a new interpretation of the history of American housing and urban design. Hayden shows how the material feminists' political ideology led them to design physical space to create housewives' cooperatives, kitchenless houses, day-care centers, public kitchens, and community dining halls. In their insistence that women be paid for domestic labor, the material feminists won the support of many suffragists and of novelists such as Edward Bellamy and William Dean Howells, who helped popularize their cause. Ebenezer Howard, Rudolph Schindler, and Lewis Mumford were among the many progressive architects and planners who promoted the reorganization of housing and neighborhoods around the needs of employed women. In reevaluating these early feminist plans for the environmental and economic transformation of American society and in recording the vigorous and many-sided arguments that evolved around the issues they raised, Hayden brings to light basic economic and spacial contradictions which outdated forms of housing and inadequate community services still create for American women and for their families.</p></p><p><p>This is a book that is full of things I have never seen before, and full of new things to say about things I thought I knew well.

It was probably more responsible than any other publication for the acceptance of Art Nouveau by the public, and as it progressed it remained the most outstanding vehicle of Art Nouveau illustration. It also had a tremendous influence on American artists and illustrators of the period. In addition to art competitions, featured articles on contemporary artists and on topics like photography, and portfolios of the work of new and unknown artists, it presented over a period of years a superb and comprehensive survey of Art Nouveau illustration by virtually every British and Continental artist of the period. <br>The selection in this volume includes both the best and the most typical in Art Nouveau. The 199 illustrations are mostly graphic arts material: book covers, posters and advertisements, title pages and end pages, bookplates, menus, Christmas cards, decorative alphabets, engraved and decorated poems, and a variety of designs and patterns. The artists include Walter Crane, Aubrey Beardsley, Will Bradley, A. A. Turbayne, Enid Jackson, R. Anning Bell, R. M. Bradley, Jessie King, Mabel Syrett, J. D. Batten, and many others. Although the book is intended primarily to be a file for commercial artists and designers, it serves the less specialized reader admirably as a survey of the various graphic styles of Art Nouveau.</p><p></p><h2>A Little Princess (Puffin Classics)</h2><p>Alone in a new country, wealthy Sara Crewe tries to make friends at boarding school and settle in.

This engaging book presents an important new chapter in paper&#x2019;s history: how its use in Islamic lands during the Middle Ages influenced almost every aspect of medieval life. Focusing on the spread of paper from the early eighth century, when Muslims in West Asia acquired Chinese knowledge of paper and papermaking, to five centuries later, when they transmitted this knowledge to Christians in Spain and Sicily, the book reveals how paper utterly transformed the passing of knowledge and served as a bridge between cultures.<br><br>Jonathan Bloom traces the earliest history of paper&#x2015;how it was invented in China over 2,000 years ago, how it entered the Islamic lands of West Asia and North Africa, and how it spread to northern Europe. He explores the impact of paper on the development of writing, books, mathematics, music, art, architecture, and even cooking. And he discusses why Europe was so quick to adopt paper from the Islamic lands and why the Islamic lands were so slow to accept printing in return. Together the beautifully written text and delightful illustrations (of papermaking techniques and the many uses to which paper was put) give new luster and importance to a now-humble material.<br></p><p><b>Jonathan M. Bloom</b>, Norma Jean Calderwood University Professor of Islamic and Asian Art at Boston College, is coauthor of <i>The Art and Architecture of Islam, </i>also<i> </i>published by Yale University Press. <br>Though paper was invented in China around 100-200 B.C., it took nearly a thousand years for Europeans to employ it and Muslims were responsible for introducing them to the technology. Bostoon College professor of Islamic and Asian art Jonathan M. Bloom explores paper's early evolution and use in Paper Before Print: The History and Impact of Paper in the Islamic World, and argues that "much in the history of Islamic civilization in the Middle Ages... can be seen in terms of the conflicting claims of memory and written record." Accompanying Bloom's elegant prose are 48 color plates and 53 b&amp;w illustrations of maps, illustrated texts of Islamic poetry, pages of the Koran, and papermaking techniques. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Sauces: Classical and Contemporary Sauce Making, 2nd Edition</h2><p>&#34;Here is yet another cookbook that can stand among the best reference works. I suspect it&#39;s a harbinger of kindred books to come as publishers begin to respond to a growing audience of cook-readers who hunger for connected, nuanced, reliably researched information..&#34; --Gourmet Magazine &#34;James Peterson has done for sauces that which Escoffier did for the cuisine of La Belle Epoque.. Sauces is a manual for the professional cook and, as such, it will rapidly become a classic and indispensable reference..&#34; --Richard Olney, From the Foreword &#34;It&#39;s the single contemporary reference on the subject that is both comprehensive and comprehensible. I love Jim&#39;s recipes (and there are gems all over the place here), but what&#39;s special about Sauces is the text: It reads so well that this is the kind of book you can take to bed.&#34; --Mark Bittman, From the Foreword &#34;This is a book I wish I had written myself.. Every few decades a book is written that says all there is to say on a subject, or has all the information and passion that sets the standard for professional and amateurs alike. Sauces is one of the best culinary books of this century in English..&#34; --Jeremiah Tower, Stars Restaurant &#34;The art of sauce making is the cornerstone of serious cooking. This book is a must for the new generation of creative cooks who wish to build on the classical French foundation with contemporary, delicious variations.&#34; --Daniel Boulud, Daniel &#34;It is a special reference book--comprehensive and inspiring..&#34; --Alice Waters, Chez Panisse</p><p>Back in 1991, when the first edition of <i>Sauces</i> was published, it's as though James Peterson said, "Okay, this is what we know so far. Where do you want to go from here?" The "what we know so far" part started with the Greeks and Romans, moved through the Middle Ages, into the Renaissance, through the 17th and 18th centuries, and right on into time as we know it, time that can be tasted in the sauce.<p> The "where do you want to go" part continues to evolve, as it always will, but remains just as evident in the way we sauce our creations, both elegant and fundamental. In the second edition of <i>Sauces</i>, released seven years after the first, the "we" has expanded beyond Frenchmen and their disciples, and now includes the broader range of flavors experienced by Italians as pasta sauces, as well as New World cooks and their counterparts in the Middle East and throughout greater Asia. The solid base from which all this grows, however, remains the lessons learned in the French kitchen--and a better kitchen for such lessons has never been developed.</p><p> To cook is one thing, to sauce another. The right sauce lifts the right dish to a wholly different plateau of dining than would be the case if the cook didn't bother. This can be a humble pasta sauce created as a perfect balance of ingredients on hand, or a carefully considered sauce the ingredients of which have been developed at the stove over days, not mere hours.</p><p> In the sauce can be seen the reflection of the cook. There is no room to hide. In the well-crafted sauce can be found the ultimate expression of simplicity, which leaves even less room to hide. It is James Peterson's great talent that he can draw the home cook and professional cook into his dialogue on sauces, and teach them both how to stay afloat in such shallow waters.</p><p> Peterson gives the reader--in close to 600 pages, mind you--the continuum on which sauces have been based in culinary history. He gives the reader the kitchen science that allows sauces to work. He gives the reader the techniques necessary to follow along where many a cook has already whisked up a splendid creation. But most of all, he gives the reader permission to go ahead and be creative, to cut loose with knowledge and technique in hand and discover for oneself the way an inkling of a flavor idea can find its way to a dish and make the combined ingredients lift off the plate. Or not. Finding out what doesn't work can be just as important.</p><p> This is a book that can be taken to bed and savored, page by page, sauce by sauce. It is a book that should be on the shelf in any kitchen, professional or homebody alike. It is not a book to ever gather dust and need dusting. <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i></p>Sauces, winner of the1991 James Beard Cookbook-of-the-Year award and the ultimate reference for sauce making, is now available in a new, update and expanded edition.

The six compact discs are &#34;music&#34; CDs, not CD-ROMs. Nobel Laureate and genius-at-large Richard Feynman gave these lectures just once, to a group of Caltech undergraduates in 1961 and 1962. He is a startlingly lucid, agile, contagiously enthusiastic communicator, and hearing him deliver these lectures himself in his broad New York accent is a great experience.</p><p><b>Richard P. Feynman</b> was raised in Far Rockaway, New York, and received his Ph.D. from Princeton. He held professorships at both Cornell and the California Institute of Technology. In 1965 he received the Nobel Prize for his work on quantum electrodynamics. He died in 1988.This book reprints the six easiest chapters from Feynman's celebrated Lectures on Physics (LJ 12/15/63), which the Nobel Prize-winning scientist delivered from 1961 to 1963 at the California Institute of Technology. Intended for as wide an audience as possible, these chapters are primarily qualitative in nature, with a minimum of formal mathematics. They discuss atoms, basic physics, the relation of physics to other sciences, the conservation of energy, gravitation, and quantum behavior. While this informative work provides a relevant historical perspective on the essentials of physics, the result is somewhat superficial. Nonetheless, because Lectures on Physics is out of print and because the information is still relevant, reprinting these specific chapters was probably a realistic move. The material will be readily understood by scholars, physics students, and informed lay readers. Recommended for academic and public libraries.

Designed as a compact source of information for those who must limit their load--hikers, kayakers, canoeists, rafters, photographers, and naturalists of all kinds--this guide will ensure that naturalists in the Arctic miss nothing.Pielou (After the Ice Age, LJ 3/1/91) again focuses on the far North in this guide to the natural history of the Arctic. While broader in scope than Bryan Sage's Arctic and Its Wildlife (LJ 4/1/87), her book is not as easy to read and lacks photography. Pielou sets the stage with opening chapters on the sky, climate, sea, and earth formations. The remaining chapters cover plants, birds, mammals, fish, and insects. A map in the plant section codes the locations for all the life forms, while charts and line drawings by the author have sufficient detail to help the reader recognize the physical formation or life form. Pielou intends this guide to be taken into the field, and the book's arrangement encourages that use.

It is a magical romance, yet deeply embedded in seventeenth-century debates about authority and power. This edition attends to the implications of Prospero&#39;s magic, his political and paternal ambitions, and the controversial issue of his &#39;colonialist&#39; control of Caliban. The Tempest was also Shakespeare&#39;s response to the new opportunities offered by the Blackfriars theatre, and careful attention is given to the play&#39;s dramatic form, stage-craft, and use of music and spectacle, to demonstrate its uniquely experimental nature.This joyous play, the last comedy of Shakespeare&#39;s career, sums up his stagecraft with a display of seemingly effortless skill. Prospero, exiled Duke of Milan, living on an enchanted island, has the opportunity to punish and forgive his enemies when he raises a tempest that drives them ashore--as well as to forestall a rebellion, to arrange the meeting of his daughter, Miranda, with an eminently suitable young prince, and, more important, to relinquish his magic powers in recognition of his advancing age. Richly filled with music and magic, romance and comedy, the play&#39;s theme of love and reconciliation offers a splendid feast for the senses and the heart.</p><h2>While Mortals Sleep: Unpublished Short Fiction</h2><p>Foreword by Dave Eggers<br><br>Smart, whimsical, and often scathing, the fiction of Kurt Vonnegut influenced a generation of American writers&#x2014;including Dave Eggers, author of this volume&#x2019;s Foreword. In these previously unpublished gems, Vonnegut&#x2019;s originality infuses a unique landscape of factories, trailers, and bars&#x2014;and characters who pit their dreams and fears against a cruel and sometimes comically indifferent world.<br> <br>Here are stories of men and machines, art and artifice, and how ideals of fortune, fame, and love take curious twists in ordinary lives. An ambitious builder of roads, commanding an army of bulldozers, graders, and asphalt spreaders, fritters away his free time with miniature trains&#x2014;until the women in his life crash his fantasy land. Trapped in a stenography pool, a young dreamer receives a call from a robber on the run, who presents her with a strange proposition. A crusty newspaperman is forced onto a committee to judge Christmas displays&#x2014;a job that leads him to a suspiciously ostentatious ex-con and then a miracle. A hog farmer&#x2019;s widow receives cryptic, unsolicited letters from a man in Schenectady about &#x201c;the indefinable sweet aches of the spirit.&#x201d; But what will she find when she goes to meet him in the flesh?<br><br>These beautifully rendered works are a testament to Vonnegut&#x2019;s unique blend of observation and imagination. Like a present left behind by a departed loved one, <i>While Mortals Sleep</i> bestows upon us a shimmering Kurt Vonnegut gift: a poignant reflection of our world as it is and as it could be.</p><p><b>Kurt Vonnegut&#x2019;s</b> black humor, satiric voice, and incomparable imagination first captured America&#x2019;s attention in <i>The Sirens of Titan</i><b> </b>in 1959 and established him as &#x201c;a true artist&#x201d; (<i>The New York Times</i>) with <i>Cat&#x2019;s Cradle</i><b><i> </i></b>in 1963. He was, as Graham Greene declared, &#x201c;one of the best living American writers.&#x201d; Mr. Vonnegut passed away in April 2007.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Dave Eggers</b> is the author of six previous books, including <i>Zeitoun, What Is the What,</i> and <i>A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius</i>. He is the founder and editor of McSweeney&#x2019;s, an independent publishing house. He lives in the San Francisco Bay Area with his wife and two children.JENNY<br><br>George Castrow used to come back to the home works of the General Household Appliances Company just once a year--to install his equipment in the shell of the new model GHA refrigerator. And every time he got there he dropped a suggestion in the suggestion box. It was always the same suggestion: "Why not make next year's refrigerator in the shape of a woman?" Then there would be a sketch of a refrigerator shaped like a woman, with arrows showing where the vegetable crisper and the butter conditioner and the ice cubes and all would go.<br><br>George called it the Food-O-Mama. Everybody thought the Food-O-Mama was an extra-good joke because George was out on the road all year long, dancing and talking and singing with a refrigerator shaped like a refrigerator. Its name was Jenny. George had designed and built Jenny back when he'd been a real comer in the GHA Research Laboratory.<br><br>George might as well have been married to Jenny. He lived with her in the back of a moving van that was mostly filled with her electronic brains. He had a cot and a hot plate and a three-legged stool and a table and a locker in the back of the van. And he had a doormat he put on the bare ground outside when he parked the van somewhere for the night. "Jenny and George," it said. It glowed in the dark.<br><br>Jenny and George went from appliance dealer to appliance dealer all over the United States and Canada. They would dance and sing and crack jokes until they'd collected a good crowd in a store. Then they would make a strong sales pitch for all the GHA appliances standing around doing nothing.<br><br>Jenny and George had been at it since 1934. George was sixty-four years old when I got out of college and joined the company. When I heard about George's big paycheck and his free way of life and the way he made people laugh and buy appliances, why I guessed he was the happiest man in the company.<br><br>But I never got to see Jenny and George until I got transferred out to the Indianapolis offices. One morning out there we got a telegram saying Jenny and George were in our neck of the woods somewhere--and would we please find them and tell George his ex-wife was very sick? She wasn't expected to live. She wanted to see him.<br><br>I was very surprised to hear he'd had a wife. But some of the older people in the office knew about her. George had only lived with her for six months--and then he'd hit the road with Jenny. His ex-wife's name was Nancy. Nancy had turned right around and married his best friend.<br>I got the job of tracking Jenny and George down. The company never knew exactly where they were. George made his own schedule. The company gave him his head. They just kept rough track of him by his expense accounts and by rave letters they'd get from distributors and dealers.<br><br>And almost every rave letter told about some new stunt that Jenny'd done, that Jenny'd never been able to do before. George couldn't leave her alone. He tinkered with her every spare minute, as though his life depended on making Jenny as human as possible.<br>I called our distributor for central Indiana, Hal Flourish. I asked him if he knew where Jenny and George were. He laughed to beat the band and said he sure did. Jenny and George were right in Indianapolis, he said. They were out at the Hoosier Appliance Mart. He told me Jenny and George had stopped early morning traffic by taking a walk down North Meridian Street.<br><br>"She had on a new hat and a corsage and a yellow dress," he said. "And George was all dolled up in his soup and fish and yellow spats and a cane. You would of died. And you know how he's got her fixed up now, so's he knows when her battery's running down?"<br><br>"Nossir," I said.<br><br>"She yawns," he said, "and her eyelids get all droopy."<br>Jenny and George were starting their first show of the day when I got out to the Hoosier Appliance Mart. It was a swell morning. George was on the sidewalk in the sunshine, leaning on the fender of the moving van that had Jenny's brains in it. He and Jenny were singing a duet. They were singing the "Indian Love Call." They were pretty good. George would sing, "I'll be calling you-hoo," in a gravel baritone. Then Jenny would answer back from the doorway of the Mart in a thin, girlish soprano.<br><br>Sully Harris, who owned the Mart, was standing by Jenny with one arm draped over her. He was smoking a cigar and counting the house.<br><br>George had on the dress suit and yellow spats Hal Flourish had laughed so hard about. George's coattails dragged on the ground. His white vest was buttoned down around his knees. His shirt bosom was rolled up under his chin like a window blind. And he had on trick shoes that looked like bare feet the size of canoe paddles. The toenails were painted fire-engine red.<br><br>But Hal Flourish is the kind of man who thinks anything that's supposed to be funny is funny. George wasn't funny if you looked at him closely. And I had to look at him closely because I wasn't there for a good time. I was bringing him sad news. I looked at him closely, and I saw a small man getting on in years and all alone in this vale of tears. I saw a small man with a big nose and brown eyes that were just sick about something.<br><br>But most people in the crowd thought he was a howl. Just here and there you'd see a few people who saw what I saw. Their smiles weren't making fun of George. Their smiles were kind of queer and sweet. Their smiles mostly seemed to ask how Jenny worked.<br>Jenny was radio-controlled, and the controls were in those trick shoes of George's--under his toes. He would punch buttons with his toes, and the shoes would send out signals to Jenny's brains in the moving van. Then the brains would signal Jenny what to do. There weren't any wires between Jenny and George and the van.<br><br>It was hard to believe George had anything to do with what Jenny was up to. He had a little pink earphone in his ear, so he could hear everything anybody said to Jenny, even when she was a hundred feet away. And he had little rearview mirrors on the frames of his glasses, so he could turn his back to her and still see everything she did.<br><br>When they stopped singing, Jenny picked me out to kid around with. "Hello, tall, dark, and handsome," she said to me. "Did the old icebox drive you out of the house?" She had a sponge rubber face at the top of the door, with springs embedded in it and a loudspeaker behind it. Her face was so real, I almost had to believe there was a beautiful woman inside the refrigerator--with her face stuck through a hole in the door.<br><br>I kidded her back. "Look, Mrs. Frankenstein," I said to her, "why don't you go off in a corner somewhere and make some ice cubes? I want to have a private talk with your boss."<br><br>Her face turned from pink to white. Her lips trembled. Then her lips pulled down and dragged her whole face out of shape. She shut her eyes so she wouldn't have to look at such a terrible person. And then, as God is my judge, she squeezed out two fat tears. They ran down her cheeks, then down her white enamelled front to the floor.<br><br>I smiled and winked at George to let him know how slick I thought his act was, and that I really did want to see him.<br><br>He didn't smile back. He didn't like me for talking to Jenny that way. You would have thought I'd spit in the eye of his mother or sister or something.<br>A kid about ten years old came up to George and said, "Hey, Mister, I bet I know how she works. You got a midget in there."<br><br>"You're the first one who ever guessed," George said. "Now that everybody knows, I might as well let the midget out." He motioned for Jenny to come out on the sidewalk with him.<br><br>I expected her to waddle and clank like a tractor, because she weighed seven hundred pounds. But she had a light step to go with that beautiful face of hers. I never saw such a case of mind over matter. I forgot all about the refrigerator. All I saw was her.<br><br>She sidled up to George. "What is it, Sweetheart?" she said.<br><br>"The jig is up," George said. "This bright boy knows you're a midget inside. Might as well come on out and get some fresh air and meet the nice people." He hesitated just long enough and looked just glum enough to make the people think maybe they were really going to see a midget.<br><br>And then there was a whirr and a click, and Jenny's door swung open. There wasn't anything inside but cold air, stainless steel, porcelain, and a glass of orange juice. It was a shock to everybody--all that beauty and personality on the outside, and all that cold nothing on the inside.<br><br>George took a sip from the glass of orange juice, put it back in Jenny and closed her door.<br><br>"I'm certainly glad to see you taking care of yourself for a change," Jenny said. You could tell she was crazy about him, and that he broke her heart about half the time. "Honestly," she said to the crowd, "the poor man should be dead of scurvy and rickets by now, the way he eats."<br><br>An audience is the nuttiest thing there is, if you ever stop to think about it. Here George had proved there wasn't anything inside Jenny, and here the crowd was, twenty seconds later, treating her like a real human being again. The women were shaking their heads to let Jenny know they knew what a trial it was to get a man to take care of himself. And the men were giving George secret looks to let him know they knew what a good pain it was to have a woman always treating you like a baby.<br><br>The only person who wasn't going along with the act, who wasn't being a boob for the pleasure of it, was the kid who'd guessed there was a midget inside. He was sore about being wrong, and his big ambition was to bust up the act with truth--Truth with a capital T. He'll grow up to be a scientist someday. "All right," the kid said, "if there isn't a midget in there, then I know exactly how it works."<br><br>"How, honey?" said Jenny. She was all ears for whatever bright little thing this kid was going to say. She really burned him up.<br><br>"Radio controls!" the kid said.<br><br>"Oooooo!" said Jenny. She was thr...</p><h2>Song of Lawino &amp; Song of Ocol (African Writers Series)</h2><p><p>One of the most successful African literary works, <i>Song of Lawino</i> (1966), is now made available in the African Writers Series together with <i>Song of Ocol</i> (1967). </p></p><p>&#x201c;Together, Song of Lawino and Song of Ocol, constitute a heated debate over the future of Africa.

This volume offers, for the first time, both often-cited foundation works and the latest writings of scholars associated with the "institutional" approach to organization analysis.<br> <br> In their introduction, the editors discuss points of convergence and disagreement with institutionally oriented research in economics and political science, and locate the "institutional" approach in relation to major developments in contemporary sociological theory. Several chapters consolidate the theoretical advances of the past decade, identify and clarify the paradigm's key ambiguities, and push the theoretical agenda in novel ways by developing sophisticated arguments about the linkage between institutional patterns and forms of social structure. The empirical studies that follow&#x2014;involving such diverse topics as mental health clinics, art museums, large corporations, civil-service systems, and national polities&#x2014;illustrate the explanatory power of institutional theory in the analysis of organizational change.<br> <br> Required reading for anyone interested in the sociology of organizations, the volume should appeal to scholars concerned with culture, political institutions, and social change.</p></p><p>This volume offers, for the first time, both often-cited foundation works and the latest writings of scholars associated with the institutional approach to organization analysis.

Wegner: Just One Good Chair</h2><p>The name of Hans J. Wegner (1914-2007) is inseparable from his unrivalled chairs, which have helped Danish design achieve international recognition. Any fan of design has his or her favorite among Wegner&#39;s approximately 500 creations, and there is hardly an interior design magazine that has not included an illustration of his elegant China Chair (1943) or Y Chair (1950). Even John F. Kennedy sat on the Round Chair, now known simply as The Chair (1949). Trained as a furniture maker, Wegner typically made his prototypes by hand, using traditional joinery techniques such as tongue-and-groove or finger joints. In the process, he often pushed the limitations of wood, giving his designs an unequaled elegance. Their beauty was matched by their practicality: he considered comfort and ergonomics to be equally as important as appearance.

Given the bewildering variety of responses that it has elicited since its publication began in January 1847, we might assume that at no time since Thackeray's serial first gained public notice has the answer to that question been obvious. To the novel's first readers, Thackeray's aim seemed puzzling. G. H. Lewes, one of the Victorian period's most able critics, wondered whether <i>Vanity Fair</i> was too embittered to be truly humorous, and too uniformly skeptical to be effectively satirical; Charlotte Bront�, however, dedicated the second edition of <i>Jane Eyre</i> to Thackeray, whom she had never met, and in the process compared the effect of <i>Vanity Fair</i> to that of a Hebrew prophet admonishing the kings of Judah and Israel. That dilemma&#x2014;whether <i>Vanity Fair</i> is the work of a moral satirist, or a worldly cynic retailing gossip for the diversion of his audience&#x2014;has haunted efforts to understand Thackeray ever since. In our own time the pendulum has swung closer to the latter sentiment, thanks in no small part to the efforts of more recent novelists and critics to discredit Thackeray's method; E. M. Forster, in his <i>Aspects of the Novel</i> (1927), compared Thackeray's interruptions of his narrative to that of a bar patron offering to buy you a drink in return for some attention to his not quite lucid stories. There have, however, been intriguing testimonies to the contrary. The Trinidadian historian, social critic, and activist intellectual C. L. R. James attested to reading <i>Vanity Fair</i> regularly starting at the age of eight, learning the workings of the British class system while feeling their persistence in his own West Indian milieu; as James later commented, it was to Thackeray, even more than to Marx, that he owed his vocation.<br>Worldly cynic, righteous prophet, tiresome companion, proto-Marxist social anatomist: the appellations are as contradictory as they are vivid and plausible. What unites these disparate accounts of the novel's effect, however, is their attempt to describe its voice&#x2014;a narrative style that speaks in a manner utterly unlike the usual Victorian novel. <i>Vanity Fair</i> is Thackeray's masterpiece, his most ambitious and colorful effort, full of characters and scenes memorable in a way his later work could only occasionally recapture; but its most important element, the fact of its presentation that accounts at once for its brilliance and its undeniable difficulty, is the voice of its narrator. Amid a babble of distinctive accents&#x2014;Becky Sharp's light, cutting wit, Jos Sedley's ponderous inanities, William Dobbin's plain, gentlemanly eloquence&#x2014;the narrator stands out as the most continually entertaining, and continually protean, of voices. The voice of <i>Vanity Fair</i>'s narrator is its great contribution to the history of the English novel, while being nonetheless the most difficult of the novel's aspects to describe fully or accurately. Without the pyrotechnic virtuosity of Dickens's style, or the measured gravitas of George Eliot, Thackeray's narrator speaks with a mixture of tones that might perhaps be the most distinctively modern among the styles of the Victorian novel.<br>Most evident of all this voice's traits is its undeniable worldliness. As the narrator frequently advertises, he (for this voice is always a male one) has seen the insides of gentlemen's clubs, society dining rooms, auction houses where the effects of bankrupts are sold, foreign courts, respectable and not-so-respectable theaters, boarding schools, tourist hotels, coaching inns, even the chambers of servants. A Londoner, evidently, this narrator can know even the secrets whispered in female drawing rooms; "every person who treads the Pall Mall pavement and frequents the clubs of this metropolis," he blandly announces, "knows, either through his own experience or through some acquaintance with whom he plays at billiards," as much as one need know about the kind of disreputable female who dresses too showily in public and who women refuse to meet. True to his worldly awareness, Thackeray's narrator refuses to spell out the full implications of his description&#x2014;how might these women earn the money to afford those dresses?&#x2014;preferring instead to let implication, and a knowing smile, do the work. The innocent and ignorant, "the apprentices in the Park" or "the squire's wife in Somersetshire, who reads of their doings in the <i>Morning Post</i>," will remain uninstructed in this curious aspect of metropolitan society. As for the narrator and his readers, surely they know enough without being explicitly instructed. "Men living about London," we are told, "are aware of these awful truths." We are in the hands, therefore, of a discreet and rather jaundiced narrative voice, acquainted with&#x2014;and perhaps already tired of&#x2014;all the restless machinations of urban strivers. <i>Vanity Fair</i> is a novel full of scandal, including fraud, petty deceit, extramarital complications, and (possibly) murder, but these putative outrages to Victorian notions of social decency are never narrated as surprises. Instead, Thackeray presents them to us with a half-amused, half-disgusted species of boredom, as if to say: Surely you weren't so na�ve as to pretend this wasn't the case?<br><br></p><h2>Copsford</h2><p>Walter Murray was a young man tired of living in the city. Early in the 1920s, he persuaded a Sussex farmer to rent him a derelict cottage, which stood alone on a hill, with no running water or electricity. Most of the windows were broken, it was dirty, dark and ran with rats. He bought a brush and pail in the village, forced the rats to retreat, brought in rudimentary furniture. The local postman found him a dog, and with his new companion he began to explore his surroundings. In that year at Copsford he made a living from collecting, drying and selling the herbs he found locally: agrimony, meadow-sweet and yarrow. He became alert to the wildlife and plants around him.

One of the greatest masterpieces of American literature, it redefined the rules of poetry while describing the soul of the American character. Throughout his life, Whitman continuously revised, expanded, and republished Leaves of Grass, but the 1855 original marked Whitman&#x2019;s fresh and bold arrival, greeted by Ralph Waldo Emerson as &#x201c;the beginning of a great career.&#x201d;&nbsp; This volume specially compiled for Penguin Drop Caps will also include a range of additional popular poems including selections from "Calamus," "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry," and "Drum-Taps," as well as Whitman&#x2019;s 1855, 1856 and 1976 prefaces and &#x201c;Democratic Vistas.&#x201d;</p><p>One of the great innovative figures in American letters, Walt Whitman created a daringly new kind of poetry that became a major force in world literature. <i>Leaves Of Grass</i> is his one book. First published in 1855 with only twelve poems, it was greeted by Ralph Waldo Emerson as "the wonderful gift . . . the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed." Over the course of Whitman's life, the book reappeared in many versions, expanded and transformed as the author's experiences and the nation's history changed and grew. Whitman's ambition was to creates something uniquely American. In that he succeeded. His poems have been woven into the very fabric of the American character. From his solemn masterpieces "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd" and "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking" to the joyous freedom of "Song of Myself," "I Sing the Body Electric," and "Song of the Open Road," Whitman's work lives on, an inspiration to the poets of later generations.The poetry of Walt Whitman is the cornerstone of modern American verse. He was America's first truly great poet and his influence is still evident today. The first edition of Whitman's "Leaves of Grass, published in 1855, was a revolutionary manifesto declaring America's independence from European cultural domination. His rhapsodic free verse broke radically with poetic, tradition: it was poetry about America, its democracy, its people, and its hopes. It was uniquely American without apology--brash, proud, optimistic, and filled with the bustling energy of the new and growing nation.<br>This collection brings together Whitman's greatest and most famous poems spanning the whole of his career. From the groundbreaking first edition of "Leaves of Grass are seven poems, including "Song of Myself" and "I Sing the Body Electric."<br>From later editions there are such masterpieces as "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry," "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking," and "I Hear America Singing." Also included is Whitman's great cycle of Civil War Poems, "Drum-Taps, which he wrote in the months when he was ministering to the wounded in battlefield hospitals. Concluding this collection is one of his last poems, "Good-bye My Fancy!"--his touching farewell to his muse, his life, and his readers.<br>More than one hundred years after his death, Walt Whitman's poetry has become part of the American heritage. It is a visionary which speaks as aptly to readers today as it will to future generations. As he says in "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry," "others...look back on me because I look'd forward to them." Whitman's poetry is a link that connects all Americans--past, present, and future.<br>This book features a deluxe cover, ribbon marker, top stain, and decorative endpaper with a nameplate.</p><h2>Pop Culture Freaks: Identity, Mass Media, and Society</h2><p><p>Love it or hate it, popular culture permeates every aspect of contemporary society.

"Literature is not a mere science, to be studied; but an art, to be practiced. Great as is our own literature, we must consider it as a legacy to be improved . . . if we persist in striving to write well, we can easily resign to other nations all the secondary fame."<br>Renowned as a critic, teacher, and educational reformer, Quiller-Couch delivered a series of lectures at the University of Cambridge in 1913-14. His subjects--the artistic and vital nature of language as well as the skills needed to convey and receive the written word--remain as timeless as his advice. This book contains the eminent scholar's remarks from those lectures on the practice of writing, the difference between verse and prose, the use of jargon, the history of English literature, the ways in which English literature is taught at the university, and the importance of style. The principles and practical guidelines he sets forth in this volume offer aspiring writers an enduring source of guidance.</p><p>Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch (1863-1944), who often published under the pen-name of &#39;Q&#39;, was one of the giants of early twentieth-century literature and literary criticism.

The ability to properly discern sounds, identify subtle problems, and act accordingly to apply the necessary fix makes all the difference in the quality of the final tracks and master. The good news is that these crucial skills can be learned. The ability to instantly identify frequencies, hear hidden distortions, and instinctively reconcile conflicts in the EQ of instruments, audio elements, vocals and more are traits of those who have mastered the art of audio production. The best engineers have trained their ears to immediately recognize audio problems that the consumer and those new to recording arts would likely not hear, but that, if left unresolved, would result in an amateurish final product. For more than two decades, students of F. Alton Everest&#39;s Critical Listening and Auditory Perception courses have rapidly developed these skills by using the intense lessons found in this book and on the CD. Unfortunately the books and CDs included with the course were usually too expensive for aspiring engineers to purchase and were often available only in colleges, universities, or school libraries. Now for the first time these indispensable training sessions are available with this release of Critical Listening Skills for Audio Professionals. Through hundreds of illustrations and an accompanying disc containing high-resolution MP3 files with nearly five hours of narration of the entire course, you can acquire the audio discernment skills of a seasoned recording engineer by studying this course at your own pace, in your own home.</p><p>The late F. Alton Everest (1909-2005) was the most respected audiologist in the professional recording industry. His revered works and courses produced more than twenty books and editions in his lifetime, including The Master Handbook of Acoustics, Audio Techniques for the Home and Studio, and How to Build a Small Budget Recording Studio from Scratch ... With 12 Tested Designs. As the supervisor of UC San Diego�s Listening Section Laboratory during WWII, Everest conducted underwater sound research experiments for the war effort. For 25 years he produced science fi lms for the renowned Moody Institute of Science, followed by years teaching and working as a highly sought after audio consultant.</p><h2>The Cruising Guide to Central and Southern California: Golden Gate to Ensenada, Mexico, Including the Offshore Islands</h2><p><p>Comprehensive and authoritative, this guide combines and updates two smaller, long-trusted regional books to provide seamless coverage of the entire California coast from just outside the Golden Gate Bridge to Mexico, with special attention given to the popular offshore islands between Point Conception and San Diego.

Yet their backgrounds and their dreams couldn&#x2019;t have been more different. Jacqueline Bouvier was a twenty-year-old debutante, a Catholic girl from a wealthy East Coast family. Susan Sontag was twenty-four, a precocious Jewish intellectual from a North Hollywood family of modest means, and Paris was a refuge from motherhood, a failing marriage, and graduate work in philosophy at Oxford. Angela Davis, a French major at Brandeis from a prominent African American family in Birmingham, Alabama, found herself the only black student in her year abroad program&#x2014;in a summer when all the news from Birmingham was of unprecedented racial violence. <br><br>Kaplan takes readers into the lives, hopes, and ambitions of these young women, tracing their paths to Paris and tracking the discoveries, intellectual adventures, friendships, and loves that they found there. For all three women, France was far from a passing fancy; rather, Kaplan shows, the year abroad continued to influence them, a significant part of their intellectual and cultural makeup, for the rest of their lives. Jackie Kennedy carried her love of France to the White House and to her later career as a book &nbsp;editor, bringing her cultural and linguistic fluency to everything from art and diplomacy to fashion and historic restoration&#x2014;to the extent that many, including Jackie herself, worried that she might seem &#x201c;too French.&#x201d; Sontag found in France a model for the life of the mind that she was determined to lead; the intellectual world she observed from afar during that first year in Paris inspired her most important work and remained a key influence&#x2014;to be grappled with, explored, and transcended&#x2014;the rest of her life. Davis, meanwhile, found that her Parisian vantage strengthened her sense of political exile from racism at home and brought a sense of solidarity with Algerian independence. For her, Paris was a city of political commitment, activism, and militancy, qualities that would deeply inform her own revolutionary agenda and soon make her a hero to the French writers she had once studied. <br><br>Kaplan, whose own junior year abroad played a prominent role in her classic memoir, <i>French Lessons</i>, spins these three quite different stories into one evocative biography, brimming with the ferment and yearnings of youth and shot through with the knowledge of how a single year&#x2014;and a magical city&#x2014;can change a whole life. No one who has ever dreamed of Paris should miss it. <br></p><p><b>Alice Kaplan</b> is the author of<i> French Lessons: A Memoir</i>, <i>The Collaborator,</i> and <i>The Interpreter</i>, and the translator of <i>OK, Joe</i>. Her books have been twice nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Awards, once for the National Book Award, and she is a winner of the Los Angeles Times Book Prize. She holds the John M. Musser chair in French literature at Yale. <br>"The #1 nonfiction book to look out for this spring." (<i>Christian Science Monitor</i>)<br><br><p>"An enduring group profile of three influential yet completely different American women, for each of whom Paris played a short but transformative role, over three tumultuous decades. . . .

In this lively, original <i>biographie � trois</i>, Alice Kaplan shows how time spent living in the French capital and learning about its culture gave each of these sui generis heroines 'her own ideas of what counted'&#x2014;and how those ideas in turn became an indelible part of the American political and cultural landscape."</p> (Caroline Weber, author of Queen of Fashion: What Marie Antoinette Wore to the Revolution)<br><br><p>"An eloquent, brilliant, and often moving portrayal of three remarkable women whose personal and intellectual engagement with France transformed them, and by extension America as well. These intimate narratives of Jaqueline Kennedy, Susan Sontag, and Angela Davis feel not only vital, but also necessary to our understanding of their moral, aesthetic and political development, and just as importantly, to our understanding of each as a remarkable, flawed, and complicated human being."</p> (Dinaw Mengestu, author of How to Read the Air)<br><br>"Alice Kaplan's triple portrait of three iconic mid-century American women, dazzles beyond our evergreen fascination with the wildly disparate lives of Jacqueline Bouvier, Susan Sontag and Angela Davis. Her lens--the 'junior year abroad'--proves to be a brilliantly revealing cultural magnifying glass. With her meticulous scholarship, a novelist's gimlet eye for detail and the sheer grace of her writing, Kaplan has given us an original and now essential model of that enduring American narrative--the American in Paris." (Patricia Hampl <i>author of I&nbsp;Could Tell You Stories</i>)<br><br>"Superbly perceptive. . . . Kaplan is a master at . . . selecting just the right aspect of everyday experience to illuminate an important point she wants to make. . . . Some books are well-written on a sentence-by-sentence basis; you leaf back through the pages to find you've underscored choice lines. <i>Dreaming in French</i> is the sort of book where you (well, I) draw vertical lines next to entire paragraphs.&nbsp;Kaplan produces some exquisite lines, yes, but she is positively incandescent on the level of thoughts and observations." (Laura Miller <i>Salon</i>)<br><br>"Lively. . .&nbsp;. The links Kaplan&nbsp;makes between these cultures and these women deliver fascinating insight to the conditions and changes surging through not only these particular lives, but those of Americans in general." (Michel Basillieres <i>Toronto Star</i>)<br><br>"Gossip is one of the key pleasures--but far from the only one--to be found in Alice Kaplan&#x2019;s absorbing new book. . . . It's a book, to some extent, about the desirability of abandoning or attenuating one&#x2019;s Americanness." (<i>Slate</i>)<br><br>"<i>Dreaming in French</i> is, in essence a collection of three short, stand-alone biographies. But Kaplan is a talented historian, journalist, and storyteller, and so she's crafted a book greater than the sum of its parts. . . . An informative, well-written work of biographical nonfiction."

Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte is edited by Richard Hoyes, Head of English and Media Studies, Farnham College, Surrey."My greatest thought in living is Heathcliff. If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be... Nelly, I <i>am</i> Heathcliff! He's always, always in my mind: not as a pleasure... but as my own being." <i>Wuthering Heights</i> is the only novel of Emily Bronte, who died a year after its publication, at the age of thirty. A brooding Yorkshire tale of a love that is stronger than death, it is also a fierce vision of metaphysical passion, in which heaven and hell, nature and society, are powerfully juxtaposed.

Since moving from the Midwest to New York City in 1969, he has been called upon by more than 500 of the nation's public and business leaders to portray them in his striking painting style. (In a 1991 <i>New York Post</i>, popular columnist Pete Hamill said that "John Howard Sanden is the closest we have in America to fit the old role of court painter.") <p></p><p>Sanden is widely regarded as the foremost teacher of professional portrait methods in the world today. Founder of the Portrait Institute of New York, he has toured the nation teaching his ideas and techniques to thousands. His books and videos have extended his teaching even further. In a 1984 article in <i>Profile</i>, the magazine of the American Portrait Society, the Society's president wrote, "John Howard Sanden may well be the best known name in contemporary American portraiture." On May 29, 1994, the American Society of Portrait Artists presented Sanden with their first John Singer Sargent Medal for Lifetime Achievement.</p>These two fine books on portraiture complement each other nicely. Sanden, a true master of the genre, has created more than 500 portraits of prominent people and is considered one of the foremost teachers of the art. He has developed a 29-step method for painting a complete pictureAin just one sitting. His premier coup technique combines immediate impression and final effect. At the heart of the book are two complete demonstrations ("The Bishop" and "Nigerian Lady") wisely chosen for varieties in skin, hair, and tones. For those interested in other media and in more basic instruction, Wolf has assembled an excellent compendium of the work of more than a dozen artists and authors. Eyes, noses, and ears get individual attention, as do the different stages of life, from infancy to maturity. The book also features methods of drawing figures in motion and within a broad variety of settings. A fine multimedia and multicultural effort. Very reasonably priced, both books are highly recommended. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Pocket Universal Methods of Design: 100 Ways to Research Complex Problems, Develop Innovative Ideas, and Design Effective Solutions</h2><p><b>The ultimate handbook for designers, students, even educators, <i>The Pocket Universal Methods of Design</i> is armed with 100 principles of design knowledge to keep your team sharp.</b><br><br> This handy, pocket-version of the <i>Universal Methods of Design</i>&nbsp;provides the same&nbsp;thorough and critical presentation of <b>100 research methods</b>,<b> synthesis/analysis techniques</b>, and<b> research deliverables</b> for human centered design.

The Nabokovs were known for their high culture and commitment to public service, and the elder Nabokov was an outspoken opponent of anti-Semitism and one of the leaders of the opposition party, the Kadets. In 1919, following the Bolshevik Revolution, he took his family into exile. Four years later he was shot and killed at a political rally in Berlin while trying to shield the speaker from right-wing assassins.&nbsp; The Nabokov household was trilingual, and as a child Nabokov was already reading Wells, Poe, Browning, Keats, Flaubert, Verlaine, Rimbaud, Tolstoy, and Chekhov alongside the popular entertainments of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Jules Verne. As a young man, he studied Slavic and romance languages at Trinity College, Cambridge, taking his honors degree in 1922. For the next&nbsp;18 years he lived in Berlin and Paris, writing prolifically in Russian under the pseudonym "Sirin" and supporting himself through translations, lessons in English and tennis, and by composing the first crossword puzzles in Russian. In 1925, he married Vera Slonim, with whom he had one child, a son, Dmitri.&nbsp; Having already fled Russia and Germany, Nabokov became a refugee once more in 1940, when he was forced to leave France for the United States. There he taught at Wellesley, Harvard, and Cornell. He also gave up writing in Russian and began composing fiction in English. His most notable works include <i>Bend Sinister&nbsp;</i>(1947),&nbsp;<i>Lolita</i>&nbsp;(1955),&nbsp;<i>Pnin</i>&nbsp;(1957), and&nbsp;<i>Pale Fire</i>&nbsp;(1962), as well as the translation of his earlier Russian novels into English. He also undertook English translations of works by Lermontov and Pushkin and wrote several books of criticism.

Both mysteries follow Inspector Barlach as he moves through worlds in which the distinction between crime and justice seems to have vanished. In <i>The Judge and His Hangman</i>, Barlach forgoes the arrest of a murderer in order to manipulate him into killing another, more elusive criminal. And in <i>Suspicion</i>, Barlach pursues a former Nazi doctor by checking into his clinic with the hope of forcing him to reveal himself. The result is two thrillers that bring existential philosophy and the detective genre into dazzling convergence. <br> <br></p></p><p><b>Friedrich D�rrenmatt </b>was born in 1921 in the village of Konolfingen, near Berne, Switzerland.

The latter includes a thoughtful foreword by Sven Birkerts, who praises D�rrenmatt's talent as a captivating entertainer who could also 'play through complex moral issues with a speed-chess decisiveness and inexorability.' . . .&nbsp;These are slender tales.

More than 400 watercolor paintings show the breathtakingly swift development of seventeen different species of wild birds. Sixteen of those species nest on Julie's wildlife sanctuary, so she knows the birds intimately, and writes about them with authority.&nbsp;To create the bulk of this extraordinary work, Julie would borrow a wild nestling, draw it, then return it to its nest every day until it fledged. Some were orphans she raised by hand, giving the ultimate insider&#x2019;s glimpse into their lives. In sparkling prose, Julie shares a lifetime of insight about bird breeding biology, growth, and cognition.<br>&nbsp;<br>As an artist and wildlife rehabilitator, Julie possesses a unique skill set that includes sketching and painting rapidly from life as well as handling delicate hatchlings. She is uniquely positioned to create such an opus, and in fact, nothing like it has ever been attempted. Julie has many fans, and she will gain many more with this unparalleled work.<br></p><p>Advance Praise for <i>Baby Birds</i><br> &nbsp;<br> "<i>Baby Birds</i> is a sweet, beak, tweet, treat.

It&#x2019;s all done in the interest of figuring them out and capturing their transformation in glorious color, hour by hour, day by day.&nbsp; When Julie peers into the nest, we all learn something important not just about bird life, but about our place in the world.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Melissa Block, NPR special correspondent&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;"There is no one I know who draws birds so exquisitely and writes so touchingly about their lives.

I loved it."<br> &#x2014;Jane Alexander, actress, author, and conservationist<br>This beautiful book is as much an art book as it is a natural history, something readers have come to expect from Julie Zickefoose. More than 400 watercolor paintings show the breathtakingly swift development of seventeen different species of wild birds. Sixteen of those species nest on Julie's Appalachian Ohio wildlife sanctuary, so she knows the birds intimately and writes about them with authority.&nbsp;To create the bulk of this extraordinary work, Julie would borrow a wild nestling, draw it, then return it to its nest every day until it fledged. Some were orphans she raised by hand, giving the ultimate insider&#x2019;s glimpse into their lives. In sparkling prose, Julie shares a lifetime of insight about bird breeding biology, growth, and cognition.<br> &nbsp;<br> As an artist and wildlife rehabilitator, Julie possesses a unique skill set that includes sketching and painting rapidly from life as well as handling delicate hatchlings. She is uniquely positioned to create such an opus, and in fact, nothing like it has ever been attempted. Julie has many fans and she will gain many more with this unparalleled work.<br></p><h2>Ultimate Italian Beginner-Intermediate (Book) (Ultimate Beginner-Intermediate)</h2><p>This deluxe course has everything you need to learn Italian from scratch or to revive the Italian that you learned years ago. <i>Ultimate Italian </i>combines conversation and culture in an easy-to-follow, enjoyable, and effective format.

Written with these flaws in mind, this new primer by N. Clayton Croy offers an effective, single-volume introduction to biblical Greek that has proven successful in classrooms around the country.This volume takes a primarily deductive approach to teaching biblical Greek and assumes that students have no prior knowledge of the language. Divided into 32 separate lessons, each containing a generous number of exercises, the text leads students from the Greek alphabet to a working understanding of the language of the Septuagint and the New Testament.<b>Special features of <i>A Primer of Biblical Greek</i></b>:<ul><li>An abundance of exercises<br>Each lesson includes practice sentences taken from the Septuagint and the New Testament as well as Greek sentences composed by the author. Exercises in English-to-Greek translation are also included.</li><li>Concise but accurate grammatical explanations<br>Great care has been taken to insure that grammatical explanations are clear, correct, and succinct. In particular, the Greek participle receives a fuller-than-usual treatment.</li><li>A natural order of presentation<br>Material is presented according to the natural structure of Greek and the traditional terminology of grammarians. Declensions and principal parts, for example, are presented in numerical order.</li><li>Inclusive language<br>The book uses inclusive language for human beings throughout.</li><li>Helpful appendixes for quick reference<br>Included at the back of the book are the Greek paradigms, Greek-to-English vocabulary, English-to-Greek vocabulary, and a bibliography for further study.</li></ul></p><p>N.

In this book Kelso proposes a new, general framework within which to connect brain, mind, and behavior.Kelso's prescription for mental life breaks dramatically with the classical computational approach that is still the operative framework for many newer psychological and neurophysiological studies. His core thesis is that the creation and evolution of patterned behavior at all levels&#x2015;from neurons to mind&#x2015;is governed by the generic processes of self-organization. Both human brain and behavior are shown to exhibit features of pattern-forming dynamical systems, including multistability, abrupt phase transitions, crises, and intermittency.</p><p>Dynamic Patterns brings together different aspects of this approach to the study of human behavior, using simple experimental examples and illustrations to convey essential concepts, strategies, and methods, with a minimum of mathematics.</p><p>Kelso begins with a general account of dynamic pattern formation. He then takes up behavior, focusing initially on identifying pattern-forming instabilities in human sensorimotor coordination. Moving back and forth between theory and experiment, he establishes the notion that the same pattern-forming mechanisms apply regardless of the component parts involved (parts of the body, parts of the nervous system, parts of society) and the medium through which the parts are coupled. Finally, employing the latest techniques to observe spatiotemporal patterns of brain activity, Kelso shows that the human brain is fundamentally a pattern forming dynamical system, poised on the brink of instability. Self-organization thus underlies the cooperative action of neurons that produces human behavior in all its forms.</p></p><p>J. A.

We have entered the Climate Casino and are rolling the global-warming dice, warns economist William Nordhaus. But there is still time to turn around and walk back out of the casino, and in this essential book the author explains how.</p><p>Bringing together all the important issues surrounding the climate debate, Nordhaus describes the science, economics, and politics involved&#x2014;and the steps necessary to reduce the perils of global warming. Using language accessible to any concerned citizen and taking care to present different points of view fairly, he discusses the problem from start to finish: from the beginning, where warming originates in our personal energy use, to the end, where societies employ regulations or taxes or subsidies to slow the emissions of gases responsible for climate change.</p><p>Nordhaus offers a new analysis of why earlier policies, such as the Kyoto Protocol, failed to slow carbon dioxide emissions, how new approaches can succeed, and which policy tools will most effectively reduce emissions. In short, he clarifies a defining problem of our times and lays out the next critical steps for slowing the trajectory of global warming.</p></p><p><b>William Nordhaus</b>, winner of the 2018 Nobel Prize in Economics and Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale University, has studied and written extensively about global warming for four decades. He lives in New Haven, CT."A one-stop source on global warming, seen through the prism of a brilliant economist."&#x2014;Fred Andrews, <i>New York Times</i><br>Selected as one of the best books of 2013 in the <i>Financial Times</i><br>"Nordhaus is arguably the world&#x2019;s leading thinker on the economics of global warming. . . . His conclusion is clear: Acting to stop climate change costs money. Ignoring the problem costs more. . . . Ultimately, this message, delivered by a number-crunching economist rather than a morally outraged environmentalist, may prove far more effective in making the case for action."&#x2014;Coral Davenport, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br>"When we have a disjunction between scientific consensus and popular perception&#x2014;that should light a fire under those of us in the news media. An excellent basis for discussion is the new book <i>The Climate Casino</i> by William Nordhaus."&#x2014;Nicholas Kristof, <i>New York Times</i><br>"Provides a comprehensive stocktaking of the possibilities and consequences of global climate change, all of which can be summed up in one sentence: 'Global warming is a trillion-dollar problem requiring a trillion-dollar solution.'"&#x2014;Sheridan Jobbins, <i>World Economic Forum</i><br><p>"The power of intelligent economics permeates William Nordhaus&#x2019;s <i>The Climate Casino . . .&nbsp;</i>the book convincingly makes the economic case for changing governmental policy, and our production and consumption habits, by offering economic incentives for low-carbon choices."&#x2014;Gail Whiteman, <i>Nature</i></p><br>"An evenhanded volume [that] will educate undergraduate students and general readers about climate change economics.

Eliot University Professor and President Emeritus at Harvard University<br>"Bill Nordhaus is one of the world&#x2019;s pioneers in applying economic reasoning to the harrowing problem of climate change.&nbsp;Before there was the UN climate treaty, the recent rounds of IPCC reports, and the Stern Review, there was Nordhaus&#x2019; path-breaking thinking, modeling, and research on the subject.&nbsp;His new book, <i>The Climate Casino</i>, marks a long-awaited update and synthesis of this work for the public and students everywhere.&nbsp;His core conclusion &#x2013; that we must act and act now &#x2013; is carefully explained with Nordhaus&#x2019; trademark vigor, clarity, and thoughtfulness. Nordhaus repeatedly and rightly reminds the reader of the risks of catastrophic tipping points and the huge unknowns concerning the ability of societies and ecosystems to adapt to the changes ahead. As he aptly puts it, by investing in slowing and eventually halting the emission of greenhouse gases humanity will be paying a well-justified 'insurance premium' for human wellbeing."&#x2014;Jeffrey D.

And they are willing to go to extraordinary lengths to get that way, even to the point of starving themselves. Why are America's women so preoccupied with weight? Is there more to this preoccupation than weight alone? What has caused record numbers of young women--even before they reach their teenage years--to suffer from weight obsession, poor body image, and disordered eating? Why are some young women able to resist cultural pressures to be thin when others are not? Are there factors within American society that have fueled current outbreaks of anorexia and bulimia? <em>The Cult of Thinness</em>, Second Edition--a revised and expanded version of Sharlene Nagy Hesse-Biber's award-winning book, <em>Am I Thin Enough</em> <em>Yet?</em> (OUP, 1996)--answers these questions and more. <br><br>Hesse-Biber goes beyond traditional psychological explanations of eating disorders to level a powerful indictment against the social, political, and economic pressures women face in a weight-obsessed society--a society that is, ironically, becoming increasingly more fat while worshipping a progressively more thin ideal. She examines the profit motives of corporate America that promote this paradox. Moreover, a new chapter on preteens, masculinity, ethnicity, gay and lesbian body image, and the globalization of body image issues align a refined cultural study of body image with the trends found in current research studies, demographic data, and popular culture.<br><br>Using the metaphor of a cult, Hesse-Biber conveys the intense, day-to-day involvement that the pursuit of thinness demands. Examining the testimonies of young women concerning the practice of body rituals, she observes the extent to which these women sacrifice their bodies and minds to the pursuit of the ultra-slender ideal. She looks at pressures coming from their families and friends that perpetuate their cult-like practices and evaluates a range of therapies and personal and collective actions available to help women overcome their weight obsessions and eating problems.<br><br>Hesse-Biber provides new frameworks for envisioning femininity and personal power, overcoming body insecurity, strengthening the inner self, and changing the cultural environment itself. Along the way, the reader is provided with important self-help tips to tackle the growing number of body image issues young women and new recruits to the "Cult of Thinness" continue to encounter.<br><br>There are alternatives to the Cult of Thinness and this book provides a strong antidote.<br></p><p>Sharlene Hesse-Biber is at Boston College.</p><h2>Engineering Mechanics: Statics</h2><p><b></b> Offers a concise yet thorough presentation of engineering mechanics theory and application.

In <i>The Heart Healers</i>, world renowned cardiologist Dr. James Forrester tells the story of the mavericks and rebels who defied the accumulated medical wisdom of the day to begin conquering heart disease. By the middle of the 20th century, heart disease was killing millions and, as with the Black Death centuries before, physicians stood helpless. Visionaries, though, had begun to make strides earlier. On Sept. 7, 1895, Ludwig Rehn successfully sutured the heart of a living man with a knife wound to the chest for the first time. Once it was deemed possible to perform surgery on the heart, others followed. In 1929, Dr. Werner Forssman inserted a cardiac catheter in his own arm and forced the x-ray technician on duty to take a photo as he successfully threaded it down the vein into his own heart...and lived. On June 6, 1944 - D-Day - another momentous event occurred far from the Normandy beaches: Dr. Dwight Harken sutured the shrapnel-injured heart of a young soldier, saved his life and the term "cardiac surgeon" born.</p><p>Dr. Forrester tells the story of these rebels and the risks they took with their own lives and the lives of others to heal the most elemental of human organs - the heart. The result is a compelling chronicle of a disease and its cure, a disease that is still with us, but one that is slowly being worn away by "The Heart Healers".</p></p><p>JAMES S. FORRESTER, MD, is an Emeritus Professor and former Chief of the Division of Cardiology at Cedars-Sinai. In addition, he is a Professor of Medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Dr. Forrester developed the Forrester classification of hemodynamic subsets of acute myocardial infarction. In the early 1990s, he led a team that developed coronary angioscopy.

Even if one is familiar with some of the players who contributed to breakthroughs in cardiovascular medicine, to learn the back stories from an expert who lived through the events is a very enriching experience.

Stewart introduces us to such characters as the Renaissance Italian genius, rogue, scholar, and gambler Girolamo Cardano, who stole the modern method of solving cubic equations and published it in the first important book on algebra, and the young revolutionary Evariste Galois, who refashioned the whole of mathematics and founded the field of group theory only to die in a pointless duel over a woman before his work was published. Stewart also explores the strange numerology of real mathematics, in which particular numbers have unique and unpredictable properties related to symmetry. He shows how Wilhelm Killing discovered Lie groups&#x201d; with 14, 52, 78, 133, and 248 dimensions-groups whose very existence is a profound puzzle. Finally, Stewart describes the world beyond superstrings: the octonionic&#x201d; symmetries that may explain the very existence of the universe.</p><p><b>Ian Stewart</b> is Professor of Mathematics at the University of Warwick and is well known for his writing and broadcasting about mathematics for nonspecialists. He has written over 140 research papers on such subjects as symmetry in dynamics, pattern formation, chaos, and mathematical biology, as well as numerous popular books, including <i>Letters to a Young Mathematician</i>, <i>Does God Play Dice?</i>, <i>What Shape Is a Snowflake?</i>, <i>Nature's Numbers</i>, <i>The Annotated Flatland</i>, and <i>Flatterland</i>. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2001. He lives in Coventry, England.*Starred Review* Werner Heisenberg recognized the numerical harmonies at the heart of the universe: "I am strongly attracted by the simplicity and beauty of the mathematical schemes which nature presents us." An accomplished mathematician, Stewart here delves into these harmonies as he explores the way that the search for symmetry has revolutionized science. Beginning with the early struggles of the Babylonians to solve quadratics, Stewart guides his readers through the often-tangled history of symmetry, illuminating for nonspecialists how a concept easily recognized in geometry acquired new meanings in algebra. Embedded in a narrative that piquantly contrasts the clean elegance of mathematical theory with the messy lives of gambling, cheating, and dueling mathematicians, the principles of symmetry emerge in radiant clarity. Readers contemplate in particular how the daunting algebra of quintics finally opened a conceptual door for Evaniste Galois, the French genius who laid the foundations for group theory, so empowering scientists with a new calculus of symmetry. Readers will marvel at how much this calculus has done to advance research in quantum mechanics, relativity, and cosmology, even inspiring hope that the supersymmetries of string theory will combine all of astrophysics into one elegant paradigm. An exciting foray for any armchair physicist! <i>Bryce Christensen</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

When one of them dies, the survivors drive his ashes from London to a seaside town where they will be scattered, compelling them to take stock in who they are today, who they were before, and the shifting relationships in between.

Fish swim by moving their body from side to side. Some swim slowly by moving their fins. Most fish, however, use their fins only to steer and keep themselves from rolling onto their side as they swim. Almost all fish have a swim bladder, a balloon-like organ that helps them float. When a fish lets air into its swim bladder, its body rises in the water. When it lets in water, its body sinks.A good introduction to the animal kingdom for the younger child.

And just because birds evolved from a single flying ancestor doesn't mean they are structurally all the same. With over 385 stunning drawings depicting 200 species, <i>The Unfeathered Bird</i> is a richly illustrated book on bird anatomy that offers refreshingly original insights into what goes on beneath the feathered surface. Each exquisite drawing is made from an actual specimen and reproduced in sumptuous large format. The birds are shown in lifelike positions and engaged in behavior typical of the species: an underwater view of the skeleton of a swimming loon, the musculature of a porpoising penguin, and an unfeathered sparrowhawk plucking its prey. Jargon-free and easily accessible to any reader, the lively text relates birds' anatomy to their lifestyle and evolution, examining such questions as why penguins are bigger than auks, whether harrier hawks really have double-jointed legs, and the difference between wing claws and wing spurs. A landmark in popular bird books, <i>The Unfeathered Bird</i> is a must for anyone who appreciates birds or bird art.</p><p> </p><ul><br> <li>A unique book that bridges art, science, and history </li><br> <li>Over 385 beautiful drawings, artistically arranged in a sumptuous large-format book </li><br> <li>Accessible, jargon-free text--the only book on bird anatomy aimed at the general reader </li><br> <li>Drawings and text all based on actual bird specimens </li><br> <li>Includes most anatomically distinct bird groups </li><br> <li>Many species never illustrated before </li><br> </ul><p></p></p><p><p>"<i>The Unfeathered Bird</i> is a marvelous fusion of art and science with a playful edge.

In its heyday during the late 1990s, neoliberalism emerged as the world's dominant economic paradigm, stretching from the Anglo-American heartlands of capitalism to the former communist bloc all the way to the developing regions of the global South. Today, however, neoliberalism has been discredited as the global economy, built on its principles, has been shaken to its core by the worst financial calamity since the 1930s. Is neoliberalism doomed or will it regain its former status? Will the new U.S. President Barack Obama embrace or reject the neoliberal agenda of his predecessors in the White House? And how will his decision impact the current global economic order? Is there a viable alternative to neoliberalism? Exploring the origins, core claims, and various forms of neoliberalism, this <em>Very Short Introduction</em> offers a concise and accessible introduction to one of the most debated "isms" of our time.<br></p><p><br><strong>Manfred B.

In <i>Indigenous London,</i> historian Coll Thrush offers an imaginative vision of the city's past crafted from an almost entirely new perspective: that of Indigenous children, women, and men who traveled there, willingly or otherwise, from territories that became Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and the United States, beginning in the sixteenth century. They included captives and diplomats, missionaries and shamans, poets and performers. Some, like the Powhatan noblewoman Pocahontas, are familiar; others, like an Odawa boy held as a prisoner of war, have almost been lost to history. In drawing together their stories and their diverse experiences with a changing urban culture, Thrush also illustrates how London learned to be a global, imperial city and how Indigenous people were central to that process.</p><p><b>Coll Thrush</b> is associate professor of history at the University of British Columbia, where he is also affiliated with UBC&#x2019;s Institute for Critical Indigenous Studies.

The notebooks<i> </i>are the repository of Williams&#x2019;s fears, obsessions, passions, and contradictions, and they form possibly the most spontaneous self-portrait by any writer in American history.<br>Meticulously edited and annotated by Margaret Thornton, the notebooks follow Williams&#x2019; growth as a writer from his undergraduate days to the publication and production of his most famous plays, from his drug addiction and drunkenness to the heights of his literary accomplishments. At one point, Williams writes, &#x201c;I feel dull and disinterested in the literary line. Dr. Heller bores me with all his erudite discussion of literature. Writing is just <i>writing</i>! Why all the fuss about it?&#x201d; This remarkable record of the life of Tennessee Williams is about writing&#x2015;how his writing came up like a pure, underground stream through the often unhappy chaos of his life to become a memorable and permanent contribution to world literature.</p><p><b>Margaret Bradham&nbsp;Thornton</b> is a writer and independent scholar based in Bedminster, New Jersey.<p>"Margaret Thornton has done something that would have delighted Tennessee Williams. She has served up his revealing notebooks with so rich of a mix of additional material and notations that the result is almost a new literary genre: a mix of diary, biography, autobiography, scrapbooks, and documentary history. It is addictive, and it bares Williams's soul."&#x2015;Walter Isaacson, author of <i>Benjamin Franklin: An American Life</i></p> (Walter Isaacson)<br><br><p>"These notebooks&#x2015;partial as they are&#x2015;will help clarify the creative and psychological highs and lows which both sustained and buffeted Tennessee Williams throughout his extraordinary life."&#x2015;Edward Albee<br><br></p> (Edward Albee)<br><br><p>"Of the more than one hundred books written about Tennessee Williams since his death, his own book,&nbsp;the&nbsp;<i>Notebooks</i>, is unique.&nbsp;It records the innermost feelings of America's greatest playwright from youth to old age, as jotted down by the playwright himself."&#x2015;Allean Hale, Krannert Theatre, University of Illinois-Urbana&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></p> (Allean Hale)<br><br><p>"Here we have Tennessee Williams on and about Tennessee Williams, more revealing even than the&nbsp;<i>Letters</i> and sometimes more vulnerable than in the <i>Memoirs</i>. Thornton has supplied a masterfully edited, copiously annotated, and lavishly illustrated edition that is invaluable for scholars and Williams fans worldwide."&#x2015;Philip C. Kolin, University of Southern Mississippi<br></p> (Philip C. Kolin)<br><br><p>"A sound and solid record of an artist's intimate mind and heart&#x2015;and while personal, the <i>Notebooks</i> offer new insight into the cognitive patterns, cultural context, and physical life of one of the twentieth century's most important writers.

Sachiko compromises valiantly to secure the future of her younger sisters. The shy, unmarried Yukiko is a hostage to her family&#x2019;s exacting standards, while the spirited Taeko rebels by flinging herself into scandalous romantic alliances and dreaming of studying fashion design in France. Filled with vignettes of a vanishing way of life, <i>The Makioka Sisters</i> is a poignant yet unsparing portrait of a family&#x2014;and an entire society&#x2014;sliding into the abyss of modernity. It possesses in abundance the keen social insight and unabashed sensuality that distinguish Tanizaki as a master novelist.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>The four Makioka sisters lead very complicated, strenuous lives, although on the surface nothing much ever happens to them. Part of a fading Japanese aristocracy in the years leading up to World War II, they cannot escape the wide net of the family name--something always brings them back to the reality of "being a Makioka." Running out of money, living in falling-apart houses, growing older beneath the sunlight of the modern world, they do their best to preserve the rituals of the past. The two older sisters work diligently to arrange a marriage for the third sister, Yukiko. Desperate to find someone to take care of her, they keep lowering their standards. One night they find themselves out with a drunk, selfish crackpot who has no money, but who is supposed to be related to a man who works for an important utility company. The fact that he is even a candidate for their sister's hand is a sign of how far they have fallen.<p> There are other signs in this remarkable, utterly compelling Japanese epic. At one point, a flood overwhelms their small town of Osaka. The youngest sister, Taeko, is having tea at the impeccably decorated home where her sewing teacher, Mrs. Tamaki, lives with her son Hiroshi. When the rain first appears beneath the door, </p><blockquote>the three were still rather enjoying themselves, shouting at each other in the best of spirits. They all had a good laugh when Hiroshi, reaching to grab the briefcase in which he had brought home his school books, bumped his head on the bobbing radio. But after perhaps a half hour, there came a moment when the three fell silent. Almost immediately, Taeko remembered afterwards, the water was above her waist. As she clutched at a curtain, a picture fell from over her head; the curtain had probably brushed against it. It was a picture Mrs. Tamaki was especially fond of.</blockquote> Junichiro Tanizaki wrestled throughout his career with the idea of a country where tribes of aristocrats live as relics, grasping at the past through gestures, manners, small and intricate private laws. The narrative suspense of <i>The Makioka Sisters</i> is rooted in this single-minded nostalgia, this strict attention to the details of domestic life as the outer world becomes more and more incomprehensible. Pages are devoted to musing about whether Yukiko should "risk" meeting a potential husband when there is a spot above her eye--maybe she should play it safe and go to the doctor about it; maybe the potential husband will interpret it as bad luck. Tanizaki manages to make the struggle over this small, dark spot wildly compelling. I could not sleep until I discovered its fate.<p> If epic literature is based in the dramatic and forward-moving narrative of a male hero's journey, <i>The Makioka Sisters</i> is a female epic of inaction--trying to figure out what to wear, crying for no reason at the same time every afternoon. With each perilous, pathetic step, the sisters are heroes setting out for the new world. They're like Odysseus, except without the ship and without the sea. <i>--Emily White</i></p>Junichiro Tanizaki was born in Tokyo in 1886 and lived there until the earthquake of 1923, when he moved to the Kyoto-Osaka region, the scene of his novel <b>The Makioka Sisters</b> (1943-48). Among his works are <b>Naomi</b> (1924), <b>Some Prefer Nettles</b> (1928), <b>Quicksand</b> (1930), <b>Arrowroot</b> (1931), <b>A Portrait of Shunkin</b> (1933), <b>The Secret History of the Lord of Musashi</b> (1935), modern versions of <b>The Tale of Genji</b> (1941, 1954, and 1965), <b>Captain Shigemoto's Mother</b><i> </i>(1949), <b>The Key</b> (1956), and <b>Diary of a Mad Old Man</b> (1961). By 1930 he had gained such renown that an edition of his complete works was published, and he was awarded Japan's Imperial Prize in Literature in 1949.

It may not even be possible to read at one setting, but it is one of those books that ought to be required reading for every citizen.&#x201d; <b><i>New York Journal of Books</i></b><br><br> A compassionate, insightful guide for military parents and the rest of us who are in their debt.&#x201d; <b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b></p><h2>The Build: Designing My Life of Choppers, Family, and Faith</h2><p><i>The Build</i> reveals the "behind the scenes" story of the popular TV reality series <i>American Chopper</i> for the show's millions of fans.&nbsp; <br> Author Paul Teutul, Jr., is arguably the most creative builder of custom "chopper" motorcycles in the world.&nbsp; His talents were revealed to millions of TV viewers worldwide on <i>American Chopper</i>, as well as later on a spinoff series, <i>American Chopper Senior vs Junior</i>. <i>The Build</i> gives the reader at Paul Jr.'s life behind the camera, which included volcanic conflict with his father and business mentor, Paul Sr. Using his own story of improbable success as an illustration, Paul Jr. offers insights on how anyone can find and activate often hidden talents.&nbsp; In a charming, often humorous way, The Build is a rallying cry to unleash God-designed creativity and live life to the fullest.</p><p>PAUL TEUTUL JR was just 27 when <i>American Chopper: Jet Bike</i> premiered on the Discovery Channel, featuring &#x201c;Paulie&#x201d; and his father, Paul Sr., building a custom chopper for 2002's Laconia Bike Week. Part of Bike Weekend, the one-off special and the intrinsic family dynamics so captivated audiences that a full series following the Teutuls and their business, Orange County Choppers, soon followed in 2003. Six years of family ups and downs ensued, culminating in 2009 with Senior firing Junior, who waited out his one-year non-compete clause before establishing his own business, Paul Jr. Designs. Today, Paul Jr. Designs continues to thrive, producing custom bikes for a variety of individual and corporate clients. There have been TV commercials and personal appearances since 2012 as well, but the most important development in Paul's life occurred when his wife, Rachael, gave birth to their son Hudson Seven Teutul in February 2015.<b>1</b><br><b>Reality or Unreality TV?<br></b><br>It remains humorous to me that after ten years of appearing on a reality television show, the question I am most often asked, by far, is whether what happened on our show was, well, <i>real.</i><br>But then again, the dynamic that made <i>American Chopper</i> a global phenomenon did appear <i>un</i>real, prompting the two to three million viewers tuning in on Monday nights to hope&#x2014;even pray, for some&#x2014;that the volatile relationship between my father and me was too bad to be true.<br><br>The premise of the show was simple: a father and son work together to build custom motorcycles. <i>American Chopper</i> worked because the bikes and our relationship were jaw-dropping. For 10 seasons and 233 one-hour episodes, my father and I were often a relational train wreck that proved equally as difficult to turn away from as to watch.<br><br>And, yes, it was real. In fact, I believe that because of my relationship with my father,<i> American Chopper</i> not only was the most real reality show, but it was the first true reality show that didn&#x2019;t involve surviving on an island.<br><br>The arguments, shouting matches, door slamming, and wall-punching were no different from my life growing up with my father, working for him in the steel business, and then building custom bikes together. The only difference once <i>American Chopper</i> started was that there were cameras around recording our blowups for the world to see.<br><br>I also have learned that there are many people with stories similar to mine&#x2014;people who are part of, or are directly impacted by, an abnormal relationship. I have nodded in understanding while listening to fans of our show describe their relationships gone bad. I have even talked with one man who might have had a worse relationship with his father than I did with mine. I had not imagined that possible.<br><br>Those conversations are one reason I decided to write this book. I have been married to Rachael for seven years now, and our strong relationship is one my parents did not have. Our son, Hudson, is coming up on three years old, and our father-son dynamic will be the complete opposite of what I grew up with. I have faith that will be the case...because of my faith. And when the opportunity arose to write a book about choppers, my family, and my faith, I said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got to do this.&#x201d;<br><br>Seeing my relationship with my father play out on a reality show for ten years was difficult because our society tends to keep such problems hidden. It has been difficult to detail in this book my bad experiences with my father because he is my dad, and I love him, and I have long desired to have a normal relationship with him.<br><br>But I kept it real on <i>American Chopper,</i> and I am keeping it real in this book, because I know there are too many others who will nod in understanding as they read my story. Although I have learned that I cannot make my father love me back no matter what I do, God loves me unconditionally, and from the overflow of His love, I can break the generational curse that has marred the Teutul family.<br><b>2</b><br><b>Meet the Family, the Whole Family<br></b><br>I am not great with dates, but I&#x2019;ll never forget September 28, 2008. That&#x2019;s the day my father fired me. Getting fired seemed devastating at the time, but it turned out to be one of the best things that could have happened to me.<br><br>I was less than a week shy of my thirty-fourth birthday when my father, with cameras rolling, fired me from Orange County Choppers. I had grown up under the same roof as my father. I had worked for him for ten years in the steel business. We had built bikes together for almost another decade, with the previous six years marked by the celebrity and contention that came from filming <i>American Chopper</i> in our upstate New York shop.<br><br>The day he fired me began a process that allowed me to come out from under the oppressive environment I had always known; I matured mentally and spiritually and flourished creatively. Until then, I had not realized how negative the dynamic with my father was, or how much and for how long he had attempted to control me. We had spent every day together, at work and outside work. It was like an unhealthy marriage.<br><br>My father had separated from my mom in 1997, after twenty-five years of marriage and four kids. But until I got fired, there was no separation from my father. I had never imagined how much good could come from something that, at the time, hurt so bad.<br><br>I&#x2019;m forty-two as I write this book, and all my life I have wanted more from my relationship with my father. But I just don&#x2019;t know if he is capable of giving more. My father is a product of his upbringing. We all are, I suppose, somewhat by nature and the rest by choice.<br><br>My parents had been split for five years when we filmed the pilot for <i>American Chopper,</i> so little is known about my mom publicly. But with my father, it takes only one episode, if that much, to peg him for what he is: loud, strong-willed, highly opinionated, and very much &#x201c;my way or the highway.&#x201d;<br><br>I have a lot of compassion for my father, because he did not grow up with good role models. His parents argued constantly in their home, and he had a horrible relationship with his mother. He&#x2019;s told me how he did not like his mother, a heavy drinker, because of how bad she treated his father in public. As a result, he did not have a nurturing relationship with her.<br><br>My father had an alcoholic mother, and I had an alcoholic father. I&#x2019;ve thought a lot about this and talked with friends and relationship experts about it, too, and for me, as a man, there is no question that I would rather have a loving, caring mother and an alcoholic father than the other way around. I feel like it&#x2019;s a game changer when there is strain or an unloving dynamic between a mother and a son, because that son will tend to have pretty big issues when he grows up. That is what I observed with my father.<br><br>My father&#x2019;s name is Paul Teutul, and once our show became a big hit, he started going by &#x201c;Senior.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m Paul Michael Teutul. While I&#x2019;m not technically &#x201c;Junior,&#x201d; I&#x2019;ve been called that since back in the days when I worked with my father in his steel business. Both of my grandfathers were named Paul, and my mom&#x2019;s name is Paula.<br><br>My parents are native New Yorkers: my mom is from Brooklyn, my father from Yonkers. They met during high school in Pearl River, which is on the New York-New Jersey border, twenty miles from midtown Manhattan. I was born in Suffern, New York, in 1974. Shortly after I arrived, my parents and I moved forty miles north to Montgomery, in Orange County, where my father and a friend started an ironworks company. I have lived in Montgomery ever since, and I don&#x2019;t see that ever changing.<br><br>My mom tells me I was a happy little kid, well-behaved and even-tempered&#x2014;and quite curious. As far back as I can remember, I enjoyed taking things apart to see how they worked and then, for the most part, putting them back together.<br><br>The grandparental support every kid needs came from my mother&#x2019;s side of the family. We were together with her parents for all the holidays and much of the time in between.<br><br>When I started kindergarten, I hated it. A kid not liking school isn&#x2019;t exactly breaking news, but saying I hated school is not an adequate description. I didn&#x2019;t like riding the bus, either, so I faked being sick to stay home as many times as I could. But the odd thing was that once I made it to school, I would be okay.<br><br>I wound up going through kindergarten twice, because I was an October baby and my parents held me back so I wouldn&#x2019;t be so young compared to the others in my class.<br><br>I struggled to stay focused in class and did not do well academically. I had the ability to apply myself, but didn&#x2019;t. That trait would stick with me for years. Place me in a situation that required mechanical ability or troubleshooting, though, and I did well, because I learned more by hands-on experience than by reading books.<br><br>Even as a kid, I was the one in the family who&#x2014;by choice&#x2014;put toys together, especially at Christmas. Whenever I read &#x201c;Assembly required,&#x201d; I eagerly accepted the challenge. I wouldn&#x2019;t read the instructions, but I would look at the picture of the finished product and figure out how to put the toy together. There might have been an extra washer or two left over when I finished, but the job always got done.<br><br>The early years of school were difficult for me because of the instability in our home created by my father&#x2019;s alcoholism. I wasn&#x2019;t old enough then to label that stage of my life, but I was insecure. Kids, earlier than we often realize, have a knack for being able to recognize when relationships are abnormal at home, regardless of whether they can put their finger on the reason or even express it.<br><br>I carried a lot of fear, too. I wanted no part of anything that took me out of my comfort zone, including being away from my mom. I think a big reason I didn&#x2019;t want to go to school was I must have been afraid that I would come home and my mom wouldn&#x2019;t be there.<br><br>When I was in third or fourth grade, I went to a weeklong Cub Scouts camp. I was so excited to go on the trip, but the instant my parents drove away, a debilitating fear overwhelmed me. I was not allowed to call home, which made matters worse. I was so afraid that I slept every night in the same sleeping bag as my best friend. When my parents picked me up at the end of camp, my mother noted that I had worn the same clothes all week. Being away from home caused more fear than I could manage.<br><br>Montgomery, at the time a town of about sixteen thousand, presented an intriguing dichotomy. Aside from all the dysfunction at home, my childhood had an all-American feel to it.<br><br>I have three siblings: brothers Daniel (Danny) and Michael (Mikey), who are two and four years younger than me, respectively; and my sister, Cristin, who was born when I was eight.<br><br>Our family lived on a small block with perhaps a dozen houses, and in our neighborhood there were plenty of kids the same ages as my brothers and me. We played a lot of backyard football growing up, with each of us wearing our favorite team&#x2019;s helmet. I proudly wore the blue helmet of my beloved New York Giants.<br><br>We also played in a cornfield at the end of the street, and there was a nearby pond where we would go bass fishing. We spent hours walking up and down railroad tracks&#x2014;which I now recommend kids <i>not&nbsp;</i>do&#x2014;and killing bees in the railroad ties. We rode bicycles on trails through the woods and built tree forts and ground forts; we flew kites on fishing poles as high in the sky as we could get them. An occasional fight would break out, and the football games grew a little rough at times, but overall, we had tons of fun in the stereotypical apple-pie setting where kids could roam carefree.<br><br>It was odd how miserable it could be inside our home, and then we would go down the street to play and life could not be any better.<br><b>My Father: Working and Drinking<br></b><br>My father was a workaholic and an alcoholic. Actually, I would say he was a raging alcoholic. Because he was self-employed, he would work and drink all day, then drink liquor all night. He would come home for dinner, and if he didn&#x2019;t like my mom&#x2019;s meal, he&#x2019;d swipe the meal off the table or smash his plate on the floor. Come to find out later, my father&#x2019;s dad had been a great cook and would use meals as compensation for weaknesses in his relationship with my father. My mom, however, wasn&#x2019;t a great cook, although being Italian and having her signature dishes, like Swedish meatballs, meatloaf, and the most delicious sauce anyone could hope to taste.<br><br>Things tended to go haywire most often at dinnertime. My father&#x2019;s violent reactions at the dinner table were always accompanied by his yelling at Mom. After he&#x2019;d throw his fit, he would go out drinking. On the occasional nights when he stayed home, he would pass out drunk on the couch.<br>My father worked hard to make money for his family and drank just as hard. My mother complained about how much he drank, so they constantly argued. I didn&#x2019;t want to take sides. When parents fight, who is supposed to be the judge and the jury? Even though I felt like my father was bullying my mom, I was a kid, and I couldn&#x2019;t make the decision of who was right and who was wrong. I don&#x2019;t think a kid <i>should</i> have to make that determination. So I learned at an early age to manage being in the middle between the two sides.<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t know then that parents yelling at each other was not normal; I had no barometer to go by. When I was at a friend&#x2019;s house and his parents had a loud discussion or maybe even an argument, the intensity was nothing compared to what I heard at home. But only in retrospect could I describe our home environment as dysfunctional, as anything other than just the way life happens. Parents screaming at each other is disturbing to a developing mind, emotionally and otherwise. My fears came from feeling that instability at home.<br><br>Our family desperately needed help, and we attended counseling sessions for what seemed like forever. For me, counseling was kind of a mixed bag. We met with numerous counselors, and I noticed that they sometimes seemed to have their own dog in our fight. It wasn&#x2019;t that counselors took sides, but in some cases it seemed that their personal experiences affected how they gave counsel. The most productive part for me was that early on the counseling helped me identify struggles I faced&#x2014;such as anger&#x2014;and that abandonment issues and broken promises were the sources of those struggles.<br><br>One thing I credit my father for is that although he was physically abused as a child, he drew a line and committed to never physically abusing his children. The most contact he would make with us when we acted up would be a smack on the butt, the legs, or the arms. But never in the head or our faces. As far as I know, he never physically abused my mother either.</p><h2>Molecular Modelling: Principles and Applications</h2><p><p>This important new edition is for graduate students studying Molecular Modelling, Computational Chemistry within Chemistry,&nbsp; Medicinal Chemistry and Biochemistry. &nbsp; Postgraduates and researchers in academia and in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries.

And Eric Foner, in <em>The New York Review of Books</em>, wrote that "the issues it raises are indispensable for understanding nineteenth-century America." It won the coveted Bancroft Prize in American History and has since become the standard source on American law for the period between 1780 and 1860. Now, Horwitz presents <em>The Transformation of American Law, 1870 to 1960</em>, the long-awaited sequel that brings his sweeping history to completion. <br> In his pathbreaking first volume, Horwitz showed how economic conflicts helped transform law in antebellum America. Here, Horwitz picks up where he left off, tracing the struggle in American law between the entrenched legal orthodoxy and the Progressive movement, which arose in response to ever-increasing social and economic inequality. Horwitz introduces us to the people and events that fueled this contest between the Old Order and the New. We sit in on <em>Lochner v. New York</em> in 1905--where the new thinkers sought to undermine orthodox claims for the autonomy of law--and watch as Progressive thought first crystallized. We meet Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. and recognize the influence of his incisive ideas on the transformation of law in America. We witness the culmination of the Progressive challenge to orthodoxy with the emergence of Legal Realism in the 1920s and '30s, a movement closely allied with other intellectual trends of the day. And as postwar events unfold--the rise of totalitarianism abroad, the McCarthyism rampant in our own country, the astonishingly hostile academic reaction to <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em>--we come to understand that, rather than self-destructing as some historians have asserted, the Progressive movement was alive and well and forming the roots of the legal debates that still confront us today.<br> The Progressive legacy that this volume brings to life is an enduring one, one which continues to speak to us eloquently across nearly a century of American life. In telling its story, Horwitz strikes a balance between a traditional interpretation of history on the one hand, and an approach informed by the latest historical theory on the other. Indeed, Horwitz's rich view of American history--as seen from a variety of perspectives--is undertaken in the same spirit as the Progressive attacks on an orthodoxy that believed law an objective, neutral entity.<br> <em>The Transformation of American Law</em> is a book certain to revise past thinking on the origins and evolution of law in our country. For anyone hoping to understand the structure of American law--or of America itself--this volume is indispensable.</p><p><br><em>About the Author</em>:<br> <strong>Morton J. Horwitz</strong> is Charles Warren Professor of American Legal History at the Harvard Law School.<br>In an important and long-awaited sequel to his classic Transformation of American Law, 1780-1860 (1977), Horwitz tells how the Progressive movement--a program for political and economic as well as legal reform--transformed American legal thought from a search for impartial norms into a discipline that acknowledged the elasticity of its own rules and that borrowed the methodologies and some of the values of the social sciences. Horwitz describes the Progressive movement (and its progeny, the Legal Realism movement of the 1920's and 1930's) as an assault on ``classical legal thought''--the view that the law constitutes an impartial body of rules administered by neutral arbiters. The author argues that centralization of the American economy--with the accompanying problems of urbanization, immigration, industrialism, and polarization of economic classes--led to a gradual reexamination of classical legal thought, particularly the bias in legal orthodoxy against redistribution of wealth. Horwitz describes how economic and, ultimately, social changes brought about by WW I put irresistible pressure on courts and legal scholars to bring jurisprudential thought into closer touch with America's rapidly changing society. But, Horwitz explains, it was the Supreme Court's controversial decision in Lochner v. New York (1905)--which invalidated a maximum-hours law for bakers on the grounds that it unconstitutionally interfered with the freedom of contract--that truly catalyzed the attacks of Progressive legal scholars on the claim that law was a politically neutral science. Through a discussion of the evolution of thought in specialized legal fields and problems, and by offering short sketches about the thought of influential figures of the period like Oliver Wendell Holmes and Legal Realists Karl Llewellyn and Jerome Frank, Horwitz demonstrates that the effect of the new thinking on American law was pervasive and lasting. Finally, he argues persuasively that the Legal Realist tradition has had an extensive effect on the development of American law in the post-WW II period. An excellent and significant reexamination of the work and impact of the Progressive and Realist legal thinkers. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Erudite and impassioned, it is a scholar-poet's quest for the meaning of European myths, a polemic about the relations between man and woman, and also an intensely personal document in which Graves explores the sources of his own inspiration and, as he believed, all true poetry.<br> Incorporating all of Graves's final revisions, his replies to two of the original reviewers, and an essay describing the months of illumination in which <i>The White Goddess </i>was written, this is the definitive edition of one of the most influential books of our time.</p></p><p>Robert Graves, the late British poet and novelist, was also known for his studies of the mythological and psychological sources of poetry. With <i>The White Goddess: A Historical Grammar of Poetic Myth</i>, Graves was able to combine many of his passions into one work. While the book is so poetically written that many of the passages amount to prose poems, it is also frequently plot driven enough to feel like a novel, and it is rich with scholarly insight into the deep wells of poetry. Especially fascinating is the chapter in which Graves explores the ancient and ongoing practice of poets' invoking the muse. Graves details the practice in both the Eastern and Western literary traditions, and shows specific similarities and differences among Greek, British, and Irish tales and myths about the muse. Graves has much to offer students of history and myth, but poetry lovers will also be fascinated with <i>The White Goddess</i>.<p><b>Robert Graves</b> (1895&#x2013;1985) was a poet, novelist, and critic. His first volume of poems, <i>Over the Brazier</i> (1916), reflected his experiences in the trenches during World War I and was followed by many works of poetry, nonfiction, and fiction. He is perhaps best known for his novel <i>I, Claudius </i>(1934), which won the Hawthornden Prize and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize. </p><p><b>Grevel Lindop</b>'s books include <i>Travels on the Dance Floor: One Man's </i><i>Journey to the Heart of Salsa</i>, <i>The English Opium Eater: A Life of Thomas De </i><i>Quincey</i>, and several volumes of poems. He was born in Liverpool and now lives in Manchester, where he was formerly a professor of Romantic and</p><p>Early Victorian Studies at the Victoria University of Manchester.</p></p><h2>Rural Hours</h2><p>Susan Augusta Fenimore Cooper (1813- 1894) was an American writer and amateur naturalist. She was the daughter of the well known novelist James Fenimore Cooper. Her most famous work is Rural Hours (1850), a nature diary of Cooperstown, New York. Amongst her works are Female Suffrage: A Letter to the Christian Women of America, The Lumley Autograph, and Elinor Wyllys; or, The Young Folk of Longbridge (1846), a novel.</p><p>In <i>Rural Hours</i>, Susan Fenimore Cooper (1813-1894), daughter of the famed novelist James Fenimore Cooper, records a year in the life of the fields and woods surrounding her home in Cooperstown, New York. She writes with a keen eye for detail, noting, for example, the disappearance of local species as their habitat is given over to farmland ("all kinds of black-birds are rare here; they are said to have been very numerous indeed at the settlement of the country, but have very much diminished in numbers of late years"), and keeping track of changes in the weather, fluctuations in animal populations, and like matters. <i>Rural Hours</i> is considered to be the first extended piece of nature writing by an American woman, and as such it should be of interest to a wide range of readers, from naturalists to students of regional literature and women's history. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>Cooper is the daughter of novelist James Fenimore Cooper.</p><h2>Late Victorian Gothic Tales (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>The Victorian <em>fin de siecle</em> has many associations: the era of Decadence, <em>The Yellow Book</em>, the New Woman, the scandalous Oscar Wilde, the Empire on which the sun never set. This heady brew was caught nowhere better than in the revival of the Gothic tale in the late Victorian age, where the undead walked and evil curses, foul murder, doomed inheritance and sexual menace played on the stretched nerves of the new mass readerships. This anthology collects together some of the most famous examples of the Gothic tale in the 1890s, with stories by Arthur Conan Doyle, Vernon Lee, Henry James and Arthur Machen, as well as some lesser known yet superbly chilling tales from the era. The introduction explores the many reasons for the Gothic revival, and how it spoke to the anxieties of the moment.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

In print for more than three decades. A master artist and teacher of metalwork presents a bold new approach to creative expression in metal. Believing that the time has come for the artist to free himself from the functional forms that have dominated the metal smith&#x2019;s craft&#x2015;the cup, the box, the pitcher, etc.&#x2015;Heikki Seppa urges the craftsman to create in terms of pure form, and in this book he shows him how. Two Things are essential. The first is a thorough understanding of the special properties of metal as an artistic medium and an intimate knowledge of techniques for working it. Only when he has mastered the physical means of working with metal can the artist free his imagination for unimpeded creation. Though not addressed to the beginner, Seppa discusses the fundamental techniques of planishing, soldering, and hinging&#x2015;all the basic means by which metal is shaped. The second is to free the artist from thinking in terms of function, since this limits his concepts of what can be created. Even such traditional forms as the cube, the cone, the cylinder, and the dome have their limitations, and Seppa opens new possibilities by creating a new vocabulary, new terms by which to identify the many shapes metal can take under skilled hands. A major feature of this book is an extensive glossary of these terms, each one illustrated with a sketch by the author. The book is profusely illustrated throughout with the author&#x2019;s own sketches of the ideas and techniques discussed. It will be of significant value to the accomplished craftsman as well as to teachers and advanced students of this exciting and growing art form. The artistic metal creations of Heikki Seppa have won international acclaim, from his award of master status in silversmithing from the Ministry of Education in his native Finland to numerous exhibits and awards here and abroad. As a teacher of metalsmithing in the School of Fine Arts of Washington University, Mr. Seppa&#x2019;s work with young artists led to the formulation of the new approach to creativity in metal that he details in this book.</p><p>One of the most innovative and influential silversmiths of the latter 20th century, the late Heikki Sepp� helped introduce the technique of reticulation to the United States while also developing and popularizing new methods for shaping sheet metal into three-dimensional shell structures. His own works are notable for their use of bold sculptural forms &#x2015; Sepp� insisted that silver could be an expressive, rather than merely utilitarian, medium &#x2015; and for combining silver and gold with other metals to create striking contrasts and color blends. Born in S�kkij�rvi, Finland, in 1927, Sepp� studied at the Goldsmith School of Helsinki and the Central School of Industrial Art in Helsinki. He continued his professional training in 1948-49 with George Jensen Silversmiths in Copenhagen, Denmark, and two years later emigrated to British Columbia, Canada, where he taught jewelry and metalsmithing at the Civic Center in Prince Rupert. Sepp� died in 2010.</p><h2>The Field Book of a Jungle-Wallah: Being a Description of Shore, River and Forest Life in Sarawak (Oxford in Asia Paperbacks)</h2><p>A description of shore, river, and forest life in Sarawak, by a distinguished civil servant in the Charles Brooke regime.</p><p></p><h2>Fundamental Concepts and Skills for Nursing</h2><p>This market-leading textbook offers an engaging format and clear writing style that make it easy to master the basic nursing concepts and skills you need to practice in a variety of care settings.

Scott explores the conflicts between the Crown and the powerful Barons, between the Norman overlords and the conquered Saxons, and between Richard and his scheming brother, Prince John. At the same time he brings into the novel the legendary Robin Hood and his band, and creates a brilliant, colourful account of the age of chivalry with all its elaborate rituals and costumes and its values of honour and personal glory.</p><p>The Bookcassette� format is a special recording technique developed as a means of condensing the full, unabridged audio text of a book to record it on fewer tapes.

Digital monopolies like Google, Facebook and Amazon act as gatekeepers to the digital world. Amazon is capturing almost all online shopping dollars. We have the illusion of choice, but for most critical decisions, we have only one or two companies, when it comes to high speed Internet, health insurance, medical care, mortgage title insurance, social networks, Internet searches, or even consumer goods like toothpaste. Every day, the average American transfers a little of their pay check to monopolists and oligopolists. The solution is vigorous anti-trust enforcement to return America to a period where competition created higher economic growth, more jobs, higher wages and a level playing field for all. <i>The Myth of Capitalism</i> is the story of industrial concentration, but it matters to everyone, because the stakes could not be higher. It tackles the big questions of: why is the US becoming a more unequal society, why is economic growth anemic despite trillions of dollars of federal debt and money printing, why the number of start-ups has declined, and why are workers losing out.</p></p><p><p><b>Praise for The Myth <i>of</i> Capitalism</b> </p><p>"'Capitalism without competition is not capitalism,' writes Jonathan Tepper in <i>The Myth of Capitalism.</i> He is right. After decades when most economists dismissed antitrust actions as superfluous so long as consumers were not the victims of price-gouging, we are slowly waking up to the reality that monopoly capitalism is back &#x2014; and it can be harmful even if its core products (as in the case of Google and Facebook) are free. But it's not just Big Tech that's killing competition. As Tepper shows in this engagingly written polemic, there's also excessive concentration in air travel, banking, beef, beer, health insurance, Internet access, and even the funeral industry. If you want to understand the real cause of rising inequality, discard Piketty and read Tepper instead. This is a tract for the times with a rare bipartisan appeal."<br> &#x2014;<b>Niall Ferguson,</b> Milbank Family Senior Fellow, the Hoover Institution, Stanford, and author of <i>The Ascent of Money</i> </p><p>"Tepper and Hearn have written an impressive and important book, documenting via their own research and that of many scholars, the very substantial increase in concentration on the supply side of US industry, leading to a decline in competition and a substantial shift in market and political power away from consumers and labor and toward the owners of capital. The consequences extend to rising inequality, slowing productivity growth, and shifts in the pattern of regulation in favor of corporations. Pieces of these growth patterns have been described before. But this book uniquely pulls it all together. One hopes that it will have the impact that it clearly deserves."<br> &#x2014;<b>Michael Spence,</b> Economics professor at Stern School of Business NYU, Nobel Prize in Economics (2001) </p><p>"What's wrong with American capitalism today? Why is it so good for the elite, and so bad for everyone else? Is inequality the problem? Tepper and Hearn make the case that inequality is the symptom, not the disease. The problem is too little competition, not too much. They provide an immensely readable and persuasive account, superbly well-informed by a mass of recent data and research."<br> &#x2014;<b>Sir Angus Deaton,</b> Princeton University, Nobel Prize in Economics (2015) </p><p>"A broad-ranging and deeply-researched analysis of the inexorable growth of monopolies and oligopolies over the past four decades. Tepper makes a compelling case that the government's failure to reign in tech titans and other corporate behemoths is at the root of perhaps the most troubling macroeconomic trends of our time, including rising inequality and slowing productivity. Clear and highly accessible, the book takes no prisoners, arguing that monopolists' funding and sloppy thinking has corrupted every aspect of the system, from politicians to regulators to academics."<br> &#x2014;<b>Kenneth Rogoff,</b> Thomas D. Cabot Professor of Public Policy and Professor of Economics at Harvard University, author of the bestselling book, <i>This Time is Different</i></p><p>Capitalism is the greatest economic system in history. It has lifted people from poverty and created widespread wealth for billions of people. Unfortunately, the so-called capitalism that exists in today's United States is the antithesis of a competitive marketplace. Monopolies and oligopolies dominate the economy, with a few winners and millions of losers. <i>The Myth of Capitalism</i> explains how we got to this state and clearly points the way back to open markets that work for everyone. </p><p>Capitalism without competition is not capitalism, but in industry after industry, competition is dying. Consider these facts: </p><ul> <li>Four airlines dominate airline traffic, often enjoying local monopolies or duopolies in their regional hubs</li> <li>Two corporations control 90% of the beer Americans drink</li> <li>Five banks control over half of the country's banking assets</li> <li>More than 75% of households with high-speed Internet access are serviced by a single provider</li> <li>Many states have health insurance markets where the top two insurers have an 80-90% market share</li> <li>Many hospitals are local monopolies, and drug companies have monopolies through patents that are endlessly extended</li> </ul> <p>Without competition, everyone suffers. Giant corporations squeeze workers' wages. Companies grow fat with record profits, sending trillions to the wealthiest. Unjust inequality rises. Dominant monopolies choke startups and manipulate markets to their advantage. Voters feel that markets are rigged, and populist politicians triumph. A truly competitive system prevents unjust inequality, averts price gouging, fosters economic growth, and encourages startups. </p><p><i>The Myth of Capitalism</i> bridges the gap between the left and the right. The authors are unabashedly pro-competition, not pro-big business. Big business is not bad, but too often size has come through mergers that have subverted capitalism.

A godlike entity in the history of rock and roll, this twentieth-century icon with a dazzling voice blended gospel and traditionally black rhythm and blues with country to create a completely new kind of music and new way of expressing male sexuality, which simply blew the doors off a staid and repressed 1950s America.</p><p>In <em>Being Elvis</em> veteran rock journalist Ray Connolly takes a fresh look at the career of the world&#x2019;s most loved singer, placing him, forty years after his death, not exhaustively in the garish neon lights of Las Vegas but back in his mid-twentieth-century, distinctly southern world. For new and seasoned fans alike, Connolly, who interviewed Elvis in 1969, re-creates a man who sprang from poverty in Tupelo, Mississippi, to unprecedented overnight fame, eclipsing Frank Sinatra and then inspiring the Beatles along the way.</p><p>Juxtaposing the music, the songs, and the incendiary live concerts with a personal life that would later careen wildly out of control, Connolly demonstrates that Elvis&#x2019;s amphetamine use began as early as his touring days of hysteria in the late 1950s, and that the financial needs that drove him in the beginning would return to plague him at the very end. With a narrative informed by interviews over many years with John Lennon, Bob Dylan, B. B. King, Sam Phillips, and Roy Orbison, among many others, Connolly creates one of the most nuanced and mature portraits of this cultural phenomenon to date.</p><p>What distinguishes <em>Being Elvis</em> beyond the narrative itself is Connolly&#x2019;s more subtle examinations of white poverty, class aspirations, and the prison that is extreme fame. As we reach the end of this poignant account, Elvis&#x2019;s death at forty-two takes on the hue of a profoundly American tragedy. The creator of an American sound that resonates today, Elvis remains frozen in time, an enduring American icon who could &#x201c;seamlessly soar into a falsetto of pleading and yearning&#x201d; and capture an inner emotion, perhaps of eternal yearning, to which all of us can still relate.</p><p>Intimate and unsparing, <em>Being Elvis</em> explores the extravagance and irrationality inherent in the Elvis mythology, ultimately offering a thoughtful celebration of an immortal life.</p> 8 pages of color, 16 pages of black-and-white photographs</p><p><p><strong>&#x201c;Hearing Elvis for the first time was like busting out of jail.

Determined to devote her life to God and to remain a virgin, Christina repulses the sexual advances of the bishop of Durham. In revenge he arranges her betrothal to a young nobleman but Christina steadfastly refuses to consummate the marriage and defies her parents' cruel coercion. Sustained by visions, she finds refuge with the hermit Roger, and lives concealed at Markyate for four years, enduring terrible physical and emotional torment. Although Christina is supported by the abbot of St Albans, she never achieves the recognition that he intended for her.<br><br>Written with striking candour by Christina's anonymous biographer, the vividness and compelling detail of this account make it a social document as much as a religious one. Christina's trials of the flesh and spirit exist against a backdrop of scheming and corruption and all-too-human greed.<br></p><p><br>Fanous and Leyser's collection of essays about Christina, published in 2005, has increased interest in the scholarly community. The St Albans Psalter, which was presented to Christina and the priory she founded, is one of the glories of twelfth-century English manuscript illumination and has now been digitized and is available on the Web.<br></p><h2>Recursive Macroeconomic Theory (The MIT Press)</h2><p><p><b>A substantially revised new edition of a widely used text, offering both an introduction to recursive methods and advanced material.</b></p><p>Recursive methods offer a powerful approach for characterizing and solving complicated problems in dynamic macroeconomics. <i>Recursive Macroeconomic Theory</i> provides both an introduction to recursive methods and advanced material, mixing tools and sample applications.

Christ, in turn, is seen in a unique light, His pure image shining in the clarity of Lao Tzu's intuitive vision. </p><p>With its practical, time-tested advice on how to unite oneself with the incarnate Tao and acquire uncreated <i>Teh,</i> this is both a philosophical source-book and a spiritual manual, touching the heart and leading one to profound inward transformation. It is a long-awaited Answer to those who, having turned away from modern Western "churchianity," are drawn to the freshness, directness and simplicity of Lao Tzu, and at the same time are strangely, inexplicably drawn back to the all-compelling reality of Jesus Christ. </p><p>The book is adorned with Chinese calligraphy and seals (created especially for it by well-known Chinese artists), and with traditional Chinese paintings of the life of Christ.</p></p><p>People of the modern West have to a great extent become jaded by Christian terminology and doctrinal constructions, yet many of them are drawn to the Person of Christ Himself. <i>Christ the Eternal Tao</i> seeks to develop not only a new way of seeing Christ, but also a <i>new language</i> by which to express His message, drawing from the enigmatic style and poetic language of Lao Tzu. <p>The uniqueness of this book lies in the fact that it is highly original and at the same time totally traditional. The content of ancient Christian experience, with all its latent power, remains the same, but it is presented in a far-seeing, all-encompassing way that soars above the bounds of Western culture. In keeping with the Chinese mind and the way of Lao Tzu, the book moves from laconic poetry to scientific precision in seeking to arrive at the "minimal": the very essence of Reality. It speaks of the mysteries of the nature of the Tao, then describes the drama of the Tao "taking flesh" in Christ, opening up the reality of the other world, and finally "emptying Himself." Practical teachings on the spiritual life are presented in detail, by which readers can enter into a direct experience of the incarnate Tao, and find their Personal Connection with the Source of the ten thousand things.</p>Since my youth I have been stirred by the beauty, simplicity and unfathomable profundity of the <i>Tao Teh Ching.</i> I used to wonder: How would it be if Christ were viewed through the innocent eyes of Lao Tzu? Why can't there be a "Gospel according to Lao Tzu," or, to put it another way, a "New Testament of the <i>Tao Teh Ching</i>"? <p>I began this book while on a trip to Russia in 1994, and continued working on it in the United States for the next four years. As the work progressed, and as I looked around at today's spiritual climate, I felt the need to write a book that would do more than enable people to add more data to their mental archives of comparative religion. I felt the book had to be able to bring the reader <i>all the way into an actual experience of Christ the eternal Tao</i> -- a book that could initiate inward, personal transformation. </p><p>Since its publication (and even before that, when portions of it were circulated around the country), the book has indeed transformed people's lives in marvelous ways. After reading it, some have taken a totally different direction in life: a direction, I believe, that accords with the Way (Tao) of Lao Tzu. Of course, I attribute this to the Power (<i>Teh</i>) of Christ the eternal Tao Himself, which works in human souls through His own words and through those of His Far-Eastern prophet, Lao Tzu.</p></p><h2>Sources of Japanese Tradition, Vol. 2</h2><p>Since it was first published more than forty years ago, <i>Sources of Japanese Tradition</i>, Volume 2, has been considered the authoritative sourcebook for readers and scholars interested in Japan from the eighteenth century to the post-World War II period. Now greatly expanded to include the entire twentieth century, and beginning in 1600, <i>Sources of Japanese Tradition</i> presents writings by modern Japan's most important philosophers, religious figures, writers and political leaders. The volume also offers extensive introductory essays and commentary to assist in understanding the documents' historical settings and significance. Wonderfully varied in its selections, this eagerly anticipated expanded edition has revised many of the texts from the original edition and added a great many not included or translated before. New additions include documents on the postwar era, the importance of education in the process of modernization, and women's issues.<br><br>Beginning with documents from the founding of the Tokugawa shogunate, the collection's essays, manifestos, religious tracts, political documents, and memoirs reflect major Japanese religious, philosophical, social and political movements. Subjects covered include the spread of neo-Confucian and Buddhist teachings, Japanese poetry and aesthetics, and the Meiji Restoration. Other documents reflect the major political trends and events of the period: the abolition of feudalism, agrarian reform, the emergence of poltical parties and liberalism, and the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese Wars. The collection also includes Western and Japanese impressions of each other through Western religious missions and commercial and cultural exchanges. These selections underscore Japanese and Western apprehension of and fascination with each other.<br><br>As Japan entered the twentieth century, new political and social movements -- Marxism, anarchism, socialism, nationalism, and feminism -- entered the national consciousness. Later readings in the collection look at the buildup to war with the United States, military defeat and American occupation. Documents from the postwar period echo Japan's struggle with its own history and its development as a capitalist democracy.</p><p>A perennial best-seller, <i>Sources of Japanese Tradition</i> has long been a staple in classrooms and libraries, a handy and comprehensive reference for scholars and students, and an engaging introduction for general readers. Now in its long-awaited second edition, this classic volume remains unrivaled for its wide selection of source readings on history, society, politics, education, philosophy, and religion in the land of the rising sun.<b>Wm.

Rather, it stops everyone in their tracks, clears the air, and allows you to get at what the real issues are. It is a proven and an amazingly effective system that avoids unwarranted assumptions, needless compromises, and wild guesses, showing:<br><br>� How to stop being needy, banishing emotional responses such as &#x201c;I must keep this customer&#x2019;s business&#x201d; or &#x201c;I have to sell this house now,&#x201d; and start focusing on what you can control&#x2014;yourself<br>� Why in a negotiation the two worst things to hear are &#x201c;yes&#x201d; and &#x201c;maybe&#x201d;<br>� How to get to the heart of the issue through the art and science of asking great questions<br>� How to find out who the real &#x201c;decider&#x201d; is and stop negotiating with the unqualified<br><br>We live in a compromise- and assumption-based world, but Jim Camp flips conventional wisdom on its head and in the process makes you a more effective negotiator with clients, customers, spouses, kids, neighbors, and coworkers.

Then when you make a decision, you set about rationalizing it. When you watch yourself and other people carefully, you can actually see the transition from one emotional state to the next&#x2014;from the emotional state to the decision state. Every day, every hour, even every minute, under some circumstances, you flip back and forth, back and forth. I want to change my career. I just do, even though I&#x2019;m doing well right here. My dad says I shouldn&#x2019;t. I know I probably shouldn&#x2019;t. But I want to. We&#x2019;ve all had such experiences. I want to buy this car. I know I shouldn&#x2019;t. Yeah, I will. Back and forth, on issues big and small. Sometimes this dynamic is plain for all to see. Sometimes it&#x2019;s almost all underground. Regardless, it is always there.<br><br>Successful negotiation of any sort requires that you understand this fact and use it. As I have already emphasized in the introduction, your overriding task as a negotiator&#x2014;in the office or in the home, with your family, or anywhere at all&#x2014; is to replace compromise- and fear-based negotiating with decision-based negotiating. You must learn to progress from raw, unexamined emotions, which never produce good agreements, to the careful decisions that eventually do. Most negotiators remain mired in their own emotions. Nor do they ever get past the emotions that are bogging the other side down. You must see the emotions on both sides for what they are and work with them, not against them. When you do, you&#x2019;re way ahead of the game and way ahead of 99 percent of your fellow men and women. But it&#x2019;s hard not to get trapped in the emotional realm, especially because of one particular emotion that dominates all others in negotiations: neediness.<br><br>Exhibit No. 1: Neediness<br><br>Why are the eyes of so many beasts like the big cats, grizzly bears, polar bears, and wolverines set in the front of the head, facing forward? Because these animals are predators always looking ahead for prey. They have no need to look back or even much to the side. They have their eyes on the prize, because this is how they make their living. Now, why are our own eyes also set in the front of the head, facing forward? Because we are predators as well. Watching children in a playground is delightful, but it is also cautionary, as every parent knows, because along with the friendships and the kindnesses we also see some king-of-the-hill, one-upmanship, bullying instincts emerge at an early age. For many, these instincts last a lifetime, as anyone who has spent much time in a nursing home knows. They accompany some of us right to the grave. (You&#x2019;ve probably seen the ad on TV with the two sets of grandparents sending pictures of their grandchildren back and forth, trying to one-up each other. The scene is played for laughs, but it also says a lot about human nature.)<br><br>Our &#x201c;one-upping,&#x201d; predatory nature is a harsh truth and not always a welcome one. But it is a vitally necessary point for you to understand. Like it or not, we are predators by nature, and the first instinct of predators is to take advantage of the fear-racked, the distressed, the vulnerable&#x2014;in one word, the needy. We humans, at least, are also capable of wonderful altruism, but we don&#x2019;t see much altruism in the world of business and negotiation, despite all the sweet talk of cagey practitioners.<br><br>In a negotiation, you may be dealing with some serious predators who are looking for the slightest sign of distress and neediness. &#x201c;Dog-eat-dog&#x201d; may not do justice to the aggression you will encounter, and good negotiators pounce on the slightest appearance of weakness. Every time you leave a long-winded message on an answering machine providing all kinds of information, you put yourself at a disadvantage. How? You&#x2019;re too anxious and therefore seem needy. Each time you answer a question with much more information than is really called for, you are showing neediness and putting yourself at risk. Every time you set a price and then lower it, you are showing need and putting yourself in a weaker position. By cutting your price without being asked to and then explaining why you felt it important to cut the price, you are showing neediness and reinforcing a bad habit.<br><br>Many business negotiators are expert in creating neediness by feeding the hopes and expectations of the other side. They paint rosy, exaggerated scenarios for year-making commissions and career-making deals&#x2014;all for the purpose of building neediness on the part of the other side for this bonanza. Then, when the neediness is well established, they lower the boom with changes, exceptions, and a host of other demands. And why not? They have the upper hand.<br><br>These are not profound observations about neediness. They are common sense, when you stop to think about them. The problem is that all too often we do not stop to think about neediness. Many trained negotiators schooled at our finest institutions have never heard a discussion of the subject, let alone considered how to deal with neediness. I know this because I&#x2019;ve lectured at these institutions. The students understand what I&#x2019;m talking about immediately&#x2014;who wouldn&#x2019;t?&#x2014;but they have no sense of how neediness plays out over the course of a negotiation. Certainly most people don&#x2019;t watch out for neediness during the negotiations encountered in their daily lives. But you must. When you slip and allow yourself to appear needy you are in danger and your negotiation is in big trouble.<br><br>You do not need this deal<br><br>Today, in our wealthy society, most of us have no good reason to need much of anything, but somehow we fool ourselves and program our minds and make statements like &#x201c;I need this leather jacket.&#x201d; Or &#x201c;I need this Maserati.&#x201d; Or &#x201c;I need to make this call.&#x201d; Or &#x201c;I need to talk to you.&#x201d; Or &#x201c;I need this opportunity.&#x201d; Or &#x201c;I need this deal.&#x201d; Or &#x201c;I need to see her.&#x201d; We use the word &#x201c;need&#x201d; much too casually.<br><br>You&#x2019;re negotiating for a new home? You love this one house so much you need it? It&#x2019;s perfect&#x2014;perfect neighborhood, school district, size, color, fixtures, garage, game room, everything? You have to have it? You&#x2019;ve decided for sure? In the first place, do you really need it? It&#x2019;s not your family or your career. It is, bottom line, a shelter with four walls (probably more) and a roof. There are others. In the second place, who says the seller is not the one with some real neediness to make this deal? Control your own neediness. If, after all the looking at houses, you decide to pay a $100,000 premium, at least you&#x2019;ve clearly understood what you&#x2019;re doing, and why. (Clearly, auctions are expressly designed to build and manipulate dueling buyers&#x2019; respective neediness. Beware.)<br><br>You do truly need the basics of physical survival&#x2014;air, water, food, clothing, and shelter&#x2014;and everyone reading this book already has these. You also need the basics of intellectual and emotional well-being for a well-lived life of love, family, friendship, satisfying work, hobbies, and faith&#x2014;each reader has his or her own list here. But it&#x2019;s a short list, and it does not&#x2014;or should not&#x2014;include the $500 jacket or the $100,000 car, because there are other jackets and other cars. Nor should the list include this particular job, deal, or agreement, because there are other jobs, deals, and agreements.<br><br>You do not need this agreement. Nevertheless, neediness is everywhere. Sometimes it is blatant and easy to spot, but just as often it is subtle and insidious.<br><br>Test Drive Take ten minutes at the end of the day and assess your actions and your conversations, looking for signs of neediness. No one knows better than you when it&#x2019;s sneaking into the picture. Honest appraisal will uncover it. Did you talk too much or too fast in a conversation, negotiation, or interview, maybe to make just the right impression? Jot this neediness down.<br><br>�Did you leave long-winded messages? Jot it down.<br><br>�Did you make the direct statement &#x201c;I need this or that&#x201d;? Jot it down.<br><br>�Did you get excited and start looking ahead at the thought of some success, great or small? Jot it down.<br><br>�When you&#x2019;re finished making your list, think carefully about the real motivation behind each item&#x2014;not the apparent motivation or the rationalized motivation, but the real one. See if you can identify the neediness.<br><br>The list of our needs is endless. Our passion for the perfect house? It includes just a wee bit of neediness to demonstrate to the world our financial success, doesn&#x2019;t it? The dueling grandparents sending pictures of the grandkids in the TV ad? There&#x2019;s some neediness in that scenario, too: the neediness to be seen as winning grandparents with successful children who are in turn rearing these incredible grandchildren.<br><br>This is the way we are&#x2014;and in our everyday lives, so what? But in negotiation it&#x2019;s a different story. In negotiation, neediness is a killer. People who understand this&#x2014;who see the big ways and little ways people express neediness&#x2014;use this understanding to great advantage.<br><br>Test Drive After you have identified your own signs of neediness on a given day, look around your world and find the signs in others: the people who talked too much in an effort to please you, who needed to be right all the time, who needed to win at all costs, who needed to be the center of attention. If you look, you&#x2019;ll find the neediness.<br><br>It is very easy to slip into such a state of neediness, often without even being aware of it. Think about something as simple as a greeting.<br><br>Hi, I&#x2019;m Betty Jones.<br><br>Hello, Ms. Jones.<br><br>Such subtle subservience could put you at an immediate disadvantage in an important negotiation. Such a response concedes that Ms. Jones is top gun in this room, and she will know it. You could be ripe for the picking. So call her Betty instead.<br><br>Consider this appeal for an appointment:<br><br>Ms. Smith, this is Bob Harris. I&#x2019;m with First Advantage Venture Fund, and I want to see if I could get ten minutes on your calendar so I can show you how we can work with you in the future.<br><br>Remember, start-up companies aren&#x2019;t the only parties who can be needy. Some start-ups are well funded and choosy regarding any venture capitalist they may bring in. Investors can also get into the needy mode, just as Bob Harris did while more or less begging for this appointment. It leaves a poor first impression. Bob should have said, &#x201c;Hi, Jill, my name is Bob Harris. I&#x2019;m not quite sure that we as a venture fund fit where you&#x2019;re going. I just don&#x2019;t know. What I&#x2019;d like to do is meet with you so we can see where you&#x2019;re going and you can look at where we&#x2019;re going at First Advantage and see if there might be a fit. When&#x2019;s the best time on your calendar?&#x201d;<br><br>No neediness in this approach. Just a calm proposal accompanied by a quiet invitation for Jill to say &#x201c;no thanks&#x201d; if she happens to have all the capital she requires.<br><br>Or say you&#x2019;re &#x201c;negotiating&#x201d; for your first job. This is a big deal. (I know. My daughter Kristi is embarking on her first job search as I write this paragraph. I remember the equivalent moments in the lives of the other kids. I remember it in my own life. It&#x2019;s a big deal, and it is a negotiation.) You have college loans on which the first payment is due in six months. You want to prove your worthiness to your parents and your family&#x2014;and yourself. And this job you&#x2019;re interviewing for is the perfect job in the perfect part of the country. You&#x2019;re losing sleep over this amazing opportunity. You are overwhelmed with enthusiasm. You are eager and accept the very first appointment time. You spend hours preparing statements about how valuable you would be to this organization. In the interview itself, you sit forward in your chair, talk a little fast, start answering before the interviewers can even finish the questions.<br><br>Tell me Harold, in school did you&#x2014;?<br><br>Oh, I loved school, I really enjoyed accounting and finance, I found I was really good in those areas and I really enjoyed my professors.<br><br>Tell me something about&#x2014;<br><br>I just love your company and the work that you do, I really think I am a perfect fit. I grew up just down the street and I know a lot about your company and its customers. I have watched all the changes and it is just amazing how far it has come.<br><br>What is your&#x2014;?<br><br>I am very strong in people skills and am a very talented listener who can focus on the issues at hand.<br><br>How many&#x2014;?<br><br>I have completed almost thirty percent of the work toward my MBA and I plan to finish part-time while working for you.<br><br>What&#x2019;s going on here? Harold&#x2019;s neediness to land this job is killing his thought process and ruining his chances. He&#x2019;s not thinking about the challenges facing the company&#x2014;he&#x2019;s not even thinking about why the company decided to interview him. He&#x2019;s practically screaming &#x201c;neediness,&#x201d; and the interviewer will not be impressed. Think about it. Imagine that you have invited this young man or woman to discuss working for you and all he or she talks about is how good he or she is, what his or her plans are, and what he or she sees as his or her greatest strength. How in the world do you hire someone like that? If you&#x2019;re like me, you&#x2019;re much more likely to consider someone who wants to know about your company and the opportunity you offer. You want someone who&#x2019;s calm, cool, and collected. You might not have put the issue in these terms before now, but you want someone who&#x2019;s not so darned needy.</p><h2>Vanishing Grace Bible Study Guide: Whatever Happened to the Good News?</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Why does the church stir up such negative feelings?&#x201d; Philip Yancey has been asking this all his life as a journalist.

The "second law," Deuteronomy portrays Moses as the founder and great lawgiver of Israel. In a series of addresses, Moses reviews his life and the life of God's people. He reminds them of the guiding hand of God, which has brought them thus far along the way, and will bring their Exodus and Wanderings to a triumphal conclusion in the Holy Land.<br><br>Through a beautiful translation and insightful comments in this first of two volumes on Deuteronomy, Weinfeld reinvigorates the basic laws of society with their life-giving power: the Shema ("Hear 0 Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One"), the Great Commandment ("You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might"). These laws govern Israelite religious and communal life under God's guidance.<br><br>Moshe Weinfeld is the foremost commentator on the Deuteronomist and the Deuteronomic School.

Instead, he lived a traveling, "homeless" life, going from temple to temple, student to student, teaching and instructing and never allowing himself to stray from his chosen path. He is responsible for making Soto Zen available to the common people outside of monasteries. <br><br> His teachings are short, sharp, and powerful. Always clear, often funny, and sometimes uncomfortably close to home, they jolt us into awakening. <br><br> Kosho Uchiyama expands and explains his teacher's wisdom with his commentary. Trained in Western philosophy, he draws parallels between Zen teachings and the Bible, Descartes, and Pascal. Shohaku Okumura has also added his own commentary, grounding his teachers' power and sagacity for the contemporary, Western practitioner. <br><br> Experience the timeless, practical wisdom of three generations of Zen masters.</p><p>Kosho Uchiyama was born in Tokyo in 1912. He received a master's degree in Western philosophy at Waseda University in 1937 and became a Zen priest three years later under Kodo Sawaki Roshi. Upon Sawaki's death in 1965, he became abbot of Antaiji, a temple and monastery then located on the outskirts of Kyoto. Uchiyama Roshi developed the practice at Antaiji and traveled extensively throughout Japan, lecturing and leading sesshins. He retired from Antaiji in 1975 and lived with his wife at Noke-in, a small temple outside Kyoto, where he continued to write, publish, and meet with the many people who found their way to his door, until his death in 1999. He wrote over twenty books on Zen, including translations of Dogen Zenji in modern Japanese with commentaries, as are various shorter essays. His <i>Opening the Hand of Thought: Foundations of Zen Buddhist Practice</i> is available in English from Wisdom Publications. He was an origami master as well as a Zen master and published several books on origami."Sawaki Roshi's profound and simple Dharma expression comes from the depth of his empty, open heart, like the light of the sun or the flow of a river, pure and unhindered, touching and awakening that same place in ourselves."

Around their predicament Longus weaves a fantasy which entertains and instructs, but never errs in taste. The hard toil and precariousness of peasant life are here, but so are its compensations--revelry, music, dance, and storytelling. Above the action brood divinities--Eros, Dionysus, Pan, the Nymphs--who collaborate to guide the adolescents into the mystery of Love, at once a sensual and a religious initiation. <em>Daphnis and Chloe</em> is the best known, and the best, of the early Greek romances, precursors to the modern novel. Admired by Goethe, it has been reinterpreted in music and art by Ravel and Chagall. This new translation is immensely readable, and does full justice to the humor and humanity of the story.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

But for some reason they choose to ignore those guidelines and churn out turgid, pompous, and obscure prose. Distinguished sociologist Howard S. Becker, true to his calling, looks for an explanation for this bizarre behavior not in the psyches of his colleagues but in the structure of his profession. In this highly personal and inspirational volume he considers academic writing as a social activity.<br><br>Both the means and the reasons for writing a thesis or article or book are socially structured by the organization of graduate study, the requirements for publication, and the conditions for promotion, and the pressures arising from these situations create the writing style so often lampooned and lamented. Drawing on his thirty-five years' experience as a researcher, writer, and teacher, Becker exposes the foibles of the academic profession to the light of sociological analysis and gentle humor. He also offers eminently useful suggestions for ways to make social scientists better and more productive writers. Among the topics discussed are how to overcome the paralyzing fears of chaos and ridicule that lead to writer's block; how to rewrite and revise, again and again; how to adopt a persona compatible with lucid prose; how to deal with that academic bugaboo, "the literature." There is also a chapter by Pamela Richards on the personal and professional risks involved in scholarly writing.<br><br>In recounting his own trials and errors Becker offers his readers not a model to be slavishly imitated but an example to inspire. Throughout, his focus is on the elusive work habits that contribute to good writing, not the more easily learned rules of grammar and punctuation. Although his examples are drawn from sociological literature, his conclusions apply to all fields of social science, and indeed to all areas of scholarly endeavor. The message is clear: you don't have to write like a social scientist to be one.</p><p><strong>Howard S. Becker</strong>&nbsp;has made major contributions to the sociology of deviance, sociology of art, and sociology of music. He has also written extensively on the practice of sociology. He received a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago, where he was also an instructor in sociology and social sciences. He became professor of sociology at Northwestern University, where he taught for twenty-five years. When he retired from active teaching he was a professor of sociology and an adjunct professor of music at the University of Washington.&nbsp;He lives and works in San Francisco and Paris.</p><h2>Loose Leaf Wardlaw&#39;s Contemporary Nutrition</h2><p>Wardlaw's Contemporary Nutrition is a complete and balanced resource for nutrition information written at a level non-science majors can understand.

Her schooling in Indiana revealed a gift for writing that led in 1901 to the publication of <i>Old Indian Legends</i>, also a Bison Book. For the rest of her rife, this Sioux was in the poignant but creative position of trying to bridge the gap between her own culture and the dominant white one, unable to return fully to the former or to enter fully into the latter.</p><p>These pieces, largely autobiographical, were first collected and published in 1921. With their reissue, Zitkala-&#x160;a takes her rightful place among such native interpreters of Sioux culture as Charles A. Eastman and Luther Standing Bear</p>.</p><p>American Indian Stories, first published in 1921, is a collection of childhood stories, allegorical fiction, and an essay. One of the most famous Sioux writers and activists of the modern era, Zitkala-Sa (Gertrude Bonnin) recalled legends and tales from oral tradition and used experiences from her life and community to educate others about the Yankton Sioux. Determined, controversial, and visionary, she creatively worked to bridge the gap between her own culture and mainstream American society and advocated for Native rights on a national level.

Because Matisse was so undogmatic in his wisdom he speaks persuasively to artist working in many different ways and in many different mediums. In fact, I think that for Matisse the ideal audience for his writings was one composed mainly of artist and students.</p><h2>JENNEY&#39;S SECOND YEAR LATIN GRADES 8-12 TEXT 1990C</h2><p><p>Praised by teachers for many years, this format is now easier to manage.&nbsp; Passages are carefully controlled to use only vocabulary and syntax already taught and tested.&nbsp; Reading-skills instruction and translation help prepare students for second-year Latin.

He studied under Plato at Athens and taught there (367&#x2013;47); subsequently he spent three years at the court of a former pupil, Hermeias, in Asia Minor and at this time married Pythias, one of Hermeias&#x2019;s relations. After some time at Mitylene, in 343&#x2013;2 he was appointed by King Philip of Macedon to be tutor of his teen-aged son Alexander. After Philip&#x2019;s death in 336, Aristotle became head of his own school (of &#x201c;Peripatetics&#x201d;), the Lyceum at Athens. Because of anti-Macedonian feeling there after Alexander&#x2019;s death in 323, he withdrew to Chalcis in Euboea, where he died in 322.Nearly all the works Aristotle prepared for publication are lost; the priceless ones extant are lecture-materials, notes, and memoranda (some are spurious).

A cup of tea, poured with clarity, taken mindfully, can help heal the world, although it might require a decade of meditation in preparation. Even one conscious breath can inspire a passerby to change her life-so important is the contribution of a single person to world change. In a sense, this discusison aniong twenty-one teachers and practitioners in this excellent, inspiring, and entirely necessary anthology is moot, because at the deepest level Buddhist practice is inherently, ineluctably engaged in the world. Any concern about Buddhism's apparent lack of formal, overt, political activism overlooks its message of non-duality-all beings, events, even thoughts, are inter-related, interpenetrating, and codependandy arising. The first half of the collection deals with thoughts on spiritual practice and social action. The absolute importance of bodying fordi the teachings into society is reiterated by a prime exemplar of this path, his Holiness, the Dalai Lama. The mind is the blueprint behind all positive and negative actions, he says; thus, controlling the mind and emotions and undergoing a profound inner transformation are prerequisites for lasting world peace and the "hope for the future." Poet Gary Snyder suggests the first step is to have "a good look at Original Mind through meditation," which leads one to "a deep concern with the need for radical social change." Zen Master Robert Aitkin links inner lucidity with deep ecology, where one "thinks like a mountain" or a black bear, "becoming truly intimate with him." This unrelenting contemplation on our Original Mind, the perception of the transience of all events, even suffering, and the endless round of samsara, blossoms into the phenomenal world of our living human neighbors through acts of compassion. "Me Bodhisattva lives by the sufferers' standards," says Snyder. The book's second half presents the biographies of exemplars of engaged Buddhism, and here the emotional weight of embodied compassion is deeply moving, engaging the reader in a shared sense of suffering and insight. The importance of even one person acting compassionately is incontrovertibly clear. Cao Ngoc Phuong recounts the act of high sacrifice her Buddhist sister Chi Mai performed when she immolated herself in 1971 for peace in waning Viet Nam. Zen sitter Judith Ragir describes her self-transformation provoked by rape, a horrific event that severely tested her Buddhist practice and left her cleansed with an astounding revelation. The exemplary embodiments of Buddhists who genuinely manifest the Dharma dissolve the illusory membrane between passivity and activism, inner retreat and outer foment. When we "speak with our lives and our bodies," says Thich Nhat Hanh, we can be very effective in changing the world, whether this action takes the form of "sitting for peace and standing for Parliament" or being an irrepressible Buddha at the supen=ket checkout. -- <i>From Independent Publisher</i></p><h2>The Annotated Wind in the Willows (The Annotated Books)</h2><p><p><strong>To celebrate <em>The Wind in the Willows</em>, scholar Annie Gauger offers this beautifully illustrated edition of Kenneth Grahame&#x2019;s classic&#x2015;complete with rare photographs of the Grahames, their friends, and illustrations from the first five editions.</strong></p><em>&#x201c;Believe me, my young friend, there is nothing&#x2015;absolutely nothing&#x2015;half so much worth doing as simply messing about in boats.&#x201d;</em>&#x2015;the Water Rat to the Mole<br><br> An instant bestseller upon its initial publication in 1908, <em>The Wind in the Willows</em> has become one of the beloved stories of all time. How could Ratty and Mole have known when they took to the river over one hundred years ago that they would begin a phenomenon that would produce one of the most oft-quoted lines in British literature, and inspire everyone from the creator of Winnie-the-Pooh to Pink Floyd? Drawing from more than a decade of research, Annie Gauger, one of the world&#x2019;s leading experts on Kenneth Grahame and <em>The Wind in the Willows</em>, now presents a fascinating new annotated edition that reintroduces readers to Otter, curmudgeonly Badger, and rollicking, boastful Toad, while revealing the secrets behind this treasured classic.<br><br> In <em>The Annotated Wind in the Willows</em>, readers will discover the sheer joy of the original text, restored to the original 1908 version, illustrated with hundreds of full-color images&#x2015;including the beloved drawings by E. H. Shepard and Arthur Rackham. This edition also includes Shepard&#x2019;s famous map of the Wild Wood and rarely seen images by illustrators Graham Robertson, Paul Bransom, Nancy Barnhart, and Wyndham Payne.<br><br> In an illuminating preface, Gauger explains how Grahame came to write the novel, which began as a bedtime story and then became a series of letters he wrote to his son, Alastair. This edition reproduces the original letters in their entirety and includes nearly a thousand delightful annotations on everything from automobiles (Toad drove an Armstrong Hardcastle Special Eight) and early motorcar etiquette to modern manifestations (Disneyland&#x2019;s Mr. Toad&#x2019;s Wild Ride). She reveals how William John Cavendish Bentinck-Scott, the peculiar Fifth Duke of Portland, built an extensive network of underground tunnels, thus inspiring the character of Badger, and she puts Grahame&#x2019;s work in literary context, comparing him to Dickens, Rudyard Kipling, A. A. Milne, and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Finally, new to this edition, long buried in the Kenneth Grahame papers, are the notes, letters, and writings by Alastair Grahame and his governess, including several pieces by Kenneth Grahame himself that have never been published before.<br><br> With a stunning, lyrical tribute to Grahame by Brian Jacques, the internationally best-selling author of the <em>Redwall</em> series, <em>The Annotated Wind in the Willows</em> should prove a most beautiful and enduring tribute to Grahame&#x2019;s masterpiece. 182 illustrations, color throughout</p><p><strong>The authoritative edition of this classic work&#x2015;now with millions of copies in print all over the world&#x2015;published to honor the author&#x2019;s 150th birthday.</strong><br><br> With a stirring introduction by Brian Jacques, the internationally best-selling author of the <em>Redwall</em> Series.<br><br> &#x201c;The tradition that Martin Gardner began with <em>The Annotated Alice</em> has been splendidly upheld by Annie Gauger.

Over the last few centuries, new democratic movements have led to the emancipation of women, slaves, and the oppressed. But what drove these modern changes, Appiah argues, was not imposing legislation from above, but harnessing the ancient power of honor from within. In gripping detail, he explores the end of the duel in aristocratic England, the tumultuous struggles over footbinding in nineteenth-century China, and the uprising of ordinary people against Atlantic slavery. Finally, he confronts the horrors of "honor killing" in contemporary Pakistan, where rape victims are murdered by their relatives. He argues that honor, used to justify the practice, can also be the most effective weapon against it. Intertwining philosophy and historical narrative, Appiah has created a remarkably dramatic work, which demonstrates that honor is the driving force in the struggle against man's inhumanity to man.</p><p>How does moral progress happen? How are societies brought to repudiate immoral customs they have long accepted? In <i>The Honor Code</i>, Kwame Anthony Appiah explores a long-neglected engine of reform. &nbsp;Examining moral revolutions in the past--and campaigns against abhorrent practices today--he shows that appeals to reason, morality, or religion aren't enough to ring in reform. Practices are eradicated only when they come into conflict with honor.<br><br> In gripping detail, Appiah begins his work with a portrait of the often-deadly world of aristocratic Britain, where for centuries gentlemen challenged each other to duels.&nbsp; Recounting one of the last significant duels in that world--between a British prime minister and an eccentric earl--Appiah shows a society at the precipice of abrupt change.&nbsp; Turning to the other side of the world, Appiah investigates the end of footbinding in China. The practice had flourished for a thousand years, despite imperial attempts at prohibition, yet was extinguished in a generation. Appiah brings to life this turbulent era and shows how change finally came not from imposing edicts from above, but from harnessing the ancient power of honor from within.<br><br> In even more intricate ways, Appiah demonstrates how ideas of honor helped drive one of history's most significant moral revolutions--the fast-forming social consensus that led to the abolition of slavery throughout the British empire, and recruited ordinary men and women to the cause.&nbsp; Yet his interest isn't just historical. &nbsp; Appiah considers the horrifying persistence of "honor killing" in places like Pakistan, despite religious and moral condemnation, and the prospects for bringing it to an end by mobilizing a sense of collective honor--and of shame.<br><br> With a storyteller's flair and a philosopher's rigor, <i>The Honor Code&nbsp;</i>represents a new approach toward moral inquiry. Ranging from a great mandarin's abandonment of an ancient Chinese tradition to Frederick Douglass's meetings with Abolitionist leaders in London, Appiah reveals how moral revolutions really succeed.<b>Kwame Anthony Appiah</b>, the president of the PEN American Center, is the author of <i>The Ethics of Identity, <em>Thinking It Through: An Introduction to Contemporary Philosophy</em>,<em> The Honor Code</em> and the prize-winning <em>Cosmopolitanism.</em> Raised in Ghana and educated in England, he has taught philosophy on three continents and is currently a professor at Princeton University.

A prompt bestseller and Pulitzer Prize-winner, <em>The Education of Henry Adams</em> (1918) recounts his own and his country's development from 1838--the year Adams was born--up to 1905, thus incorporating the Civil War, unprecedented capitalist expansion, and the growth of the United States as a world power. Adams considered the nation both a success and a failure, and this paradox was the very impetus that compelled him to set down his <em>Education</em>--in the pages of which he also voiced a deep skepticism about mankind's ability to control the direction of history. Written with immense wit and irony, reassembling the past while glimpsing at the future, this book wholly expresses what Henry James declared the "complex fate" of being an American. Adams's thoroughly documented vision remains one of the most absorbing American autobiographies ever written.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.<br></p><p>Many great artists have had at least intermittent doubts about their own abilities. But <i>The Education of Henry Adams</i> is surely one of the few masterpieces to issue directly from a raging inferiority complex. The author, to be sure, had bigger shoes to fill than most of us. Both his grandfather and great-grandfather were U.S. presidents. His father, a relative underachiever, scraped by as a member of Congress and ambassador to the Court of St. James. But young Henry, born in Boston in 1838, was destined for a walk-on role in his nation's history--and seemed alarmingly aware of the fact from the time he was an adolescent.<p> It gets worse. For the author could neither match his exalted ancestors nor dismiss them as dusty relics--he was an Adams, after all, formed from the same 18th-century clay. "The atmosphere of education in which he lived was colonial," we are told, </p><blockquote>revolutionary, almost Cromwellian, as though he were steeped, from his greatest grandmother's birth, in the odor of political crime. Resistance to something was the law of New England nature; the boy looked out on the world with the instinct of resistance; for numberless generations his predecessors had viewed the world chiefly as a thing to be reformed, filled with evil forces to be abolished, and they saw no reason to suppose that they had wholly succeeded in the abolition; the duty was unchanged.</blockquote> Here, as always, Adams tells his story in a third-person voice that can seem almost extraplanetary in its detachment. Yet there's also an undercurrent of melancholy and amusement--and wonder at the specific details of what was already a lost world.<p> Continuing his uphill conquest of the learning curve, Adams attended Harvard, which didn't do much for him. ("The chief wonder of education is that it does not ruin everybody concerned in it, teachers and taught.") Then, after a beer-and-sausage-scented spell as a graduate student in Berlin, he followed his father to Washington, D.C., in 1860. There he might have remained--bogged down in "the same rude colony ... camped in the same forest, with the same unfinished Greek temples for workrooms, and sloughs for roads"--had not the Civil War sent Adams <i>p�re et fils</i> to London. Henry sat on the sidelines throughout the conflict, serving as his father's private secretary and anxiously negotiating the minefields of English society. He then returned home and commenced a long career as a journalist, historian, novelist, and peripheral participant in the political process--a kind of mouthpiece for what remained of the New England conscience.</p><p> He was not, by any measure but his own, a failure. And the proof of the pudding is <i>The Education of Henry Adams</i> itself, which remains among the oddest and most enlightening books in American literature. It contains thousands of memorable one-liners about politics, morality, culture, and transatlantic relations: "The American mind exasperated the European as a buzz-saw might exasperate a pine forest." There are astonishing glimpses of the high and mighty: "He saw a long, awkward figure; a plain, ploughed face; a mind, absent in part, and in part evidently worried by white kid gloves; features that expressed neither self-satisfaction nor any other familiar Americanism..." (That would be Abraham Lincoln; the "melancholy function" his Inaugural Ball.) But most of all, Adams's book is a brilliant account of how his own sensibility came to be. A literary landmark from the moment it first appeared, the <i>Autobiography</i> confers upon its author precisely that prize he felt had always eluded him: success. <i>--James Marcus</i></p>'I cannot remember when I was not fascinated by Henry Adams, ' said Gore Vidal. 'He was remarkably prescient about the coming horrors.' <br>His political ideals shaped by two presidential ancestors--great-grandfather John Adams and grandfather John Quincy Adams--Henry Adams was one of the most powerful and original minds to confront the American scene from the Civil War to the First World War. <br>Printed privately in 1907 and published to wide acclaim shortly after the author&amp;'s death in 1918, The Education of Henry Adams is a brilliant, idiosyncratic blend of autobiography and history that charts the great transformation in American life during the so-called Gilded Age. <br>With an introduction by renowned historian Edmund Morris.</p><h2>Classic Guitar Technique, Vol. 1</h2><p>One of the most popular classical guitar methods ever written.

To the people who lived in that system the collapse seemed both completely unexpected and completely unsurprising. At the moment of collapse it suddenly became obvious that Soviet life had always seemed simultaneously eternal and stagnating, vigorous and ailing, bleak and full of promise. Although these characteristics may appear mutually exclusive, in fact they were mutually constitutive. This book explores the paradoxes of Soviet life during the period of "late socialism" (1960s-1980s) through the eyes of the last Soviet generation.</p><br><p> Focusing on the major transformation of the 1950s at the level of discourse, ideology, language, and ritual, Alexei Yurchak traces the emergence of multiple unanticipated meanings, communities, relations, ideals, and pursuits that this transformation subsequently enabled. His historical, anthropological, and linguistic analysis draws on rich ethnographic material from Late Socialism and the post-Soviet period.</p><br><p> The model of Soviet socialism that emerges provides an alternative to binary accounts that describe that system as a dichotomy of official culture and unofficial culture, the state and the people, public self and private self, truth and lie--and ignore the crucial fact that, for many Soviet citizens, the fundamental values, ideals, and realities of socialism were genuinely important, although they routinely transgressed and reinterpreted the norms and rules of the socialist state.</p></p><p><p><strong><em></em></strong>"In this remarkable book, Alexei Yurchak asks: How can we account for the paradox that Soviet people both experienced their system as immutable and yet were unsurprised by its end? In answering this question, he develops a brilliant, entirely novel theory of the nature of Soviet socialism and the reasons for its collapse. The book is must reading for anyone interested in this most momentous change of contemporary history, as well as in the place of language in social transformation. A tour de force!"--<strong>Katherine M. Verdery, author of <em>What Was Socialism, and What Comes Next?</em></strong></p> <p>"Alexei Yurchak brilliantly debunks several widely held misconceptions about the lived experience of late socialism in Soviet Russia, and does so through a compelling dossier of materials, all creatively conceived, organized, and analyzed. The writing is fluid, accessible, interesting, and beautifully structured and styled."--<strong>Nancy Ries, Colgate University, author of <em>Russian Talk: Culture and Conversation during Perestroika</em></strong></p> <p>"This ambitious book admirably combines a new theoretical approach with detailed ethnographic materials. Written in a clear and engaging style, it is both thorough and precise, and provides a new and convincing insight that will definitely be central to all serious discussions of Soviet-type systems for years to come--namely, that the shift in Soviet life from a semantic to a pragmatic model of ideological discourse served to undermine the ideological system."--<strong>Caroline Humphrey, University of Cambridge, author of <em>The Unmaking of Soviet Life</em></strong></p> <p>"This book makes an important contribution not only to anthropological studies of the former Soviet Union but to the broader discussion about Soviet power, ethics, and public space. Yurchak provides a subtle alternative to traditions of debate in Sovietology that counterposed an analysis of totalitarian accounts of Soviet power to the 'revisionists' of the 1970s who saw a much more dynamic space of social maneuverings. What is more, he persuasively shows a level of commitment to Soviet ideals that has rarely been appreciated in scholarship. Indeed, he makes the important point that many Russians actually have memories of being much more critical of the Soviet Union than they actually were when it existed."--<strong>Stephen Collier, New School University</strong></p><b>Alexei Yurchak</b> is Assistant Professor of Anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley.</p><h2>Principles of Neurobiology</h2><p><p><em>Liqun Luo&nbsp;is the recipient of the 2019 Pradel Research Award from the National Academy of Science</em></p> <p>https://twitter.com/CRCPress/status/1089903325733097472</p> <p></p> <p><em>Principles of Neurobiology</em> presents the major concepts of neuroscience with an emphasis on how we know what we know.

A variety of algorithms are described in each of the following areas: sorting, searching, string-processing, geometric, graph, and mathematical algorithms. These algorithms are expressed in terms of concise implementations in C, so that readers can both appreciate their fundamental properties and test them on real applications. The treatment of analysis of algorithms is carefully developed. When appropriate, analytic results are discussed to illustratewhy certain algorithms are preferred, and in some cases, the relationship of the practical algorithms being discussed to purely theoretical results is also described. It features hundreds of detailed, innovative figures clearly demonstrate how important algorithms work. Throughout the book, properties sections encapsulate specific information on the performance characteristics of algorithms. Six chapters present fundamental concepts, including a brief introduction to data structures. Algorithms in C provides readers with the tools to confidently implement, run, and debug useful algorithms. Th</p><p><i>Algorithms in C</i> is a comprehensive repository of algorithms, complete with code. If you're in a pinch and need to code something up fast, this book is the place to look. Starting with basic data structures, <i>Algorithms in C</i> covers an enormous scope of information, with extensive treatment of searching and advanced data structures, sorting, string processing, computational geometry, graph problems, and mathematical algorithms. Although the manual often neglects to provide rigorous analysis, the text surrounding the algorithms provides clear and relevant insight into why the algorithms work.This book is intended to survey the most important computeralgorithms in use today and to teach fundamental techniques tothe growing number of people in need of knowing them. It can beused as a textbook for a second, third, for fourth course incomputer science, after students have acquired some programmingskills and familiarity with computer systems, but before theyhave taken specialized courses in advanced areas of computerscience or computer applications. Additionally, the book may beuseful for self-study or as a reference for those engaged in thedevelopment of computer systems or applications programs, sinceit contains a number of implementations of useful algorithms anddetailed information on their performance characteristics. Thebroad perspective taken in the book makes it an appropriateintroduction to the field.<p>SCOPE</p><p>The book contains 45 chapters grouped into 8 major parts: fundamentals, sorting, searching, string processing, geometricalgorithms, graph algorithms, mathematical algorithms andadvanced topics. A major goal in developing this book has beento bring together the fundamental methods from these diverseareas, in order to provide access to the best methods known forsolving problems by computer. Some of the chapters giveintroductory treatments of advanced material. It is hoped thatthe descriptions here can give readers some understanding of thebasic properties of fundamental algorithms ranging from priorityqueues and hashing to simplex and the fast Fourier transform.</p><p>One or two previous courses in computer science or equivalentprogramming experience are recommended for a reader to be able toappreciate the material in this book: one course in programmingin a high-level language such as C or Pascal, and perhaps anothercourse which teaches fundamental concepts of programming systems. This book is thus intended for anyone conversant with a modernprogramming language and with the basic features of moderncomputer systems. References that might help fill in gaps inone's background are suggested in the text.</p><p>Most of the mathematical material supporting the analytic resultsis self contained (or labeled as "beyond the scope" of thisbook), so little specific preparation in mathematics is requiredfor the bulk of the book, though a certain amount ofmathematical maturity is definitely helpful. A number of thelater chapters deal with algorithms related to more advancedmathematical material--these are intended to place the algorithmsin context with other methods throughout the book, not to teachthe mathematical material. Thus the discussion of advancedmathematical concepts is brief, general, and descriptive.</p><p>USE IN THE CURRICULUM</p><p>There is a great deal of flexibility in how the material here canbe taught. To a large extent, the individual chapters in thebook can be read independently of the others, though in somecases, algorithms in one chapter make use of methods from aprevious chapter. The material can be adapted for use forvarious courses by selecting perhaps 25 or 30 of the 45 chapters,according to the taste of the instructor and the preparation ofthe students.</p><p>The book begins with an introductory section on data structuresand the design and analysis of algorithms. This sets the tonefor the rest of the book and provides a framework within whichmore advanced algorithms are treated. Some readers may skip orskim this section; others may learn the basics there.</p><p>An elementary course on "data structures and algorithms" mightomit some ofthe mathematical algorithms and some of the advancedtopics, then emphasize how various data structures are used inthe implementations. An intermediate course on "design andanalysis of algorithms" might omit some of the more practicallyoriented sections, then emphasize the identification and study ofthe ways in which algorithms achieve good asymptotic performance. A course on "software tools" might omit the mathematical andalgorithmic material, then emphasize how to integrate theimplementations given here into large programs or systems. Acourse on "algorithms" might take a survey approach and introduceconcepts from all these areas.</p><p>Some instructors may wish to add supplementary material to thecourses described above to reflect their particular orientation. For "data structures and algorithms", extra material on basicdata structures could be taught; for "design and analysis ofalgorithms," more mathematical analysis could be added; and for"software tools," software engineering techniques could becovered in more depth. In this book, attention is paid to allthese areas, but the emphasis is on the algorithms themselves.</p><p>Earlier versions of this book have been used in recent years atscores of colleges and universities around the country as a textfor the second or third course in computer science and assupplemental reading for other courses. At Princeton, ourexperience has been that the breadth of coverage of material inthis book provides our majors with an introduction to computerscience that can later be expanded upon in later courses onanalysis of algorithms, systems programming and theoreticalcomputer science, while at the same time providing all thestudents with a large set of techniques that they can immediatelyput to good use.</p><p>There are 450 exercises, ten following each chapter, thatgenerally divide into two types. Most are intended to teststudents' understanding of material in the text, and ask studentsto work through an example or apply concepts described in thetext. A few of them, however, involve implementing and puttingtogether some of the algorithms, perhaps running empiricalstudies to compare algorithms and to learn their properties.</p><p>ALGORITHMS OF PRACTICAL USE</p><p>The orientation of the book is toward algorithms likely to be ofpractical use. The emphasis is on teaching students the tools oftheir trade to the point that they can confidently implement, runand debug useful algorithms. Full implementations of the methodsdiscussed are included in the text, along with descriptions ofthe operations of these programs on a consistent set of examples. Indeed, as discussed in the epilog, hundreds of figures areincluded in the book that have been created by the algorithmsthemselves. Many algorithms are brought to light on an intuitivelevel throughout the visual dimension provided by these figures.</p><p>Characteristics of the algorithms and situations in which theymight be useful are discussed in detail. Though not emphasized,connections to the analysis of algorithms and theoreticalcomputer science are not ignored. When appropriate, empiricaland analytic results are discussed to illustrate why certainalgorithms are preferred. When interesting, the relationship ofthe practical algorithms being discussed to purely theoreticalresults is described. Specific information on performancecharacteristics of algorithms is encapsulated throughout the"properties," important facts about the algorithms that deservefurther study.</p><p>While there is little direct treatment of specific uses of thealgorithms in science and engineering applications, the potentialfor such use is mentioned when appropriate. Our experience hasbeen that when students learn good algorithms in a computerscience context early in their education, they are able to applythem to solve problems when warranted later on.</p><p>PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</p><p>The programming language used throughout the book is C (a Pascalversion of the book is also available). Any particular languagehas advantages and disadvantages; we use C because it is widelyavailable and provides the features needed for ourimplementations. The programs can easily be translated to othermodern programming languages, since relatively few C constructsare used. Indeed, many of the programs have been translated fromPascal and other languages, though we try to use standard Cidioms when appropriate. </p><p>Some of the programs can be simplified by using more advancedlanguage features, but this is true less often than one mightthink. Although language features are discussed whenappropriate, this book is not intended to be a reference work onC programming. When forced to make a choice, we concentrate onthe algorithms, not implementation details.</p><p>A goal of this book is to present the algorithms in as simple anddirect a form as possible. The programs are intended to be readnot by themselves, but as part of the surrounding text. Thisstyle was chosen as an alternative, for example, to having inlinecomments. the style is consistent whenever possible, so thatprograms that are similar look similar.</p><p>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</p><p>Many people gave me helpful feedback on earlier versions of thisbook.

Though Don had nodirect influence on this work, his presence may be felt in thebook, for it was he who put the study of algorithms on ascientific footing that makes a work such as this possible.</p><p>I am very thankful for the support of Brown University and INRIAwhere I did most of the work on the book, and the Institute forDefense Analyses and the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, where Idid some work on the book while visiting.

Acclaimed authors Gene Hall, Linda Quinn, and Donna Gollnick thoroughly prepare teacher education candidates to make a difference as teachers, presenting first-hand stories and evidence-based practices while offering a student-centered approach to learning. The authors target one of the biggest challenges facing many of today&#x2019;s schools&#x2015;making sure that all students are learning&#x2015;and help teachers make student learning the primary focus in all that they do. From true-to-life challenges that teachers will face (high-stakes testing, student learning assessments, low teacher retention, Common Core Standards) to the inspiration and joy they will discover throughout their teaching careers, this text paints a realistic picture of the real life of a teacher.</p><p><strong>Gene E.

This integration is coupled with the specific discussion of multicultural theory as a theory in and of itself. This multidimensional approach to multiculturalism champions the current thinking of our time which celebrates an integrative and infused perspective." -- Nicole Hill<br><br>"It brings a fresh perspective (postmodern, multiple perspectives, multicultural intentionality &#x2015; concepts not addressed in my text and other similar texts) to understanding theories of counseling and psychotherapy." -- Claire Sham Choy<br><br>"I strive to make multiculturalism a central theme in all of my classes, yet I often feel like I&#x2019;m floundering and lacking in support. Within this textbook, I feel like I have the support I need to give these issues the attention they deserve." -- Dr. Lisa Cromer<br><br>"Finally, a textbook that centralizes multicultural-feminist-social justice movements and positive psychology (as well as constructivism and postmodernism) without tacking them on to the end! A terrific book for a course in theories or in multicultural counseling." -- Sharon Horne, Ph.D<br><br>"The multicultural-feminist-social justice movement paradigm fully addresses a multicultural plus perspective. Often typical of other texts is a lack of emphasis of this topic. This multicultural plus perspective is an asset to this text. [...] Finally a textbook that emphasizes the new Positive Psychology movement! The more I read this text, the more I like it." -- Meredyth G. Fellows<br><br>"After reading Ivey et al., I sensed that, finally, one text could bring to together harmoniously nearly all the varied, if not disparate, theoretical voices of the counseling profession. In doing so, the book reads like a gifted ensemble sounds. Second, the individual parts of the book balance depth and breadth. Finally, the authors provide the student with a solid working model for counseling." -- James Korcuska</p><h2>The Mabinogion (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Celtic mythology, Arthurian romance, and an intriguing interpretation of British history--these are just some of the themes embraced by the anonymous authors of the eleven tales that make up the Welsh medieval masterpiece known as the<em> Mabinogion</em>.

The dreams are so vivid&#x2014;so wildly creative&#x2014;that I know God is in charge of my imagination. I couldn&#x2019;t dream up this shit without God. God has to be the author of my dreams. In one dream, I&#x2019;m with Miles Davis. We&#x2019;re dressed like African princes. Our robes are blue and gold. Miles is singing and I&#x2019;m playing trumpet. Black angels are surrounding us. We&#x2019;re bathed in sunlight. We&#x2019;re on top of the Empire State Building and everyone in the city of New York can hear us. The people are assembled on the street; they&#x2019;re hanging out their windows and waving flags from office buildings. Helicopters are flying over us, but our music is so powerful that we drown out all noise. Our music is some symphony that has the angels dancing in the sky.<br> <br>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t know you could play jazz so good,&#x201d; Miles says to me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t know you could sing so funky,&#x201d; I say to him.<br> <br>The music is so beautiful I start crying through Miles&#x2019;s horn.<br> <br>Someone says, &#x201c;The hospitals are clearing out. The patients are healed.&#x201d;<br> <br>Someone else says, &#x201c;The churches are clearing. The congregations are in the streets.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I told you,&#x201d; says Miles. &#x201c;I told you we could do it.&#x201d;<br> <br>When I put the trumpet to my lips again, the horn turns into a megaphone. When I start to speak, I hear the voice of my mother.<br> <br>&#x201c;My son has the answer,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Miles gave him the answer. Listen to my son.&#x201d;<br> <br>I turn to Miles, who rarely smiles, and see that he is smiling.<br> <br>When I wake up from this dream, I am smiling.<br> <br>But I&#x2019;m still in jail.<br> <br><br> <br>This long stay in jail is the first time I&#x2019;m remembering my dreams. I&#x2019;m not even sure I had dreams before they put my ass behind bars. My mind was clogged up with cocaine&#x2014;not just any cocaine, but cocaine strong enough to fuel jet engines. I was a jet engine that got dislodged from the plane of my brain. I crashed to the ground and broke into a million pieces. When the pieces magically came back together, the engine could work again. But the fuel was no longer cocaine. The fuel was something I hadn&#x2019;t used since I was a little boy. I&#x2019;d call it natural energy and natural drive. It&#x2019;s a natural restlessness to see and explore and learn. Couldn&#x2019;t do any of that exploring when I was ripping and running through the world of intoxicants. Didn&#x2019;t wanna explore. Just wanted to stay high.<br> <br>So ain&#x2019;t this a bitch? My highs are my dreams. My dreams are my escape. And my imagination is my way out of prison. If you break down the word &#x201c;imagination,&#x201d; I guess it means manufacturing images. Dreaming is the purest form of that process&#x2014;so, for as long as I&#x2019;m locked up, I&#x2019;m gonna write down my dreams.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m also gonna write down my life.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve always wanted to write my own life story. But outside of prison I could never sit down and be quiet. My energy was scattered. I was always going in a dozen different directions at once. But now I got no choice. Got nowhere to go and nothing to do. I&#x2019;m forced to read. And in reading&#x2014;especially about the lives of people I relate to&#x2014;I get excited. I read about Charlie Parker, Nat King Cole, Bob Marley, and Malcolm X, and I understand exactly why their lives went the way they did. I see their fuckups as my fuckups; I see their talents as my talents. Sometimes talent is so big it takes you to places that you don&#x2019;t understand. Super talent doesn&#x2019;t take you to the Land of Peace; it takes you to Crazyland. And if you ain&#x2019;t emotionally grounded in something rock-solid, you gonna get annihilated.<br> <br>I got annihilated. Now I&#x2019;m getting healed. And part of the healing is dreaming, remembering, and writing.<br> <br>I can write in peace because I don&#x2019;t have access to my lethal vices. Being a celebrity in jail also means I have protectors who keep the bad cats away from me. They see I&#x2019;m serious about writing and form a shield around me.<br> <br>In prison, I&#x2019;ve gravitated toward the bookish brothas. I&#x2019;ve met Muslims who have taken me deep into the Koran. I love and respect Islam. I was raised Catholic but never really studied the Bible till late in life. The Christian brothas in prison have given me a new way to look at the Word. A Jewish man has been talking about Kabbalah, mysticism with wisdom of its own.<br> <br>Don&#x2019;t worry. I ain&#x2019;t gonna shove no religion down your throat. I&#x2019;m not using this book to win converts. I&#x2019;m just using the book to manufacture images from my past. I just wanna look at old pictures, lay &#x2019;em out there, and, like a jigsaw puzzle, see if I can make the pieces fit. See if I can make sense of a life of nonsense and understand how I got to be caged up like an animal.<br> <br>I am an animal, a fuckin&#x2019; wild animal. I lost my human soul. I lost my human mind. But in this animal cage, my intention is to win back my humanity.

This approach emphasizes mutuality and debunks the idea that psychoanalysis needs to cling to authoritarianism to maintain its essential integrity. The author discusses the desire for transformation, which seems to motivate not only patients but their therapists as well, and emphasizes the transference-countertransference interplay, noting that both patient and therapist will try to re-enact their past dramas.&#34;</p><p>Karen J.

She explains how counter-transference would work, how to incorporate it into therapy sessions, and what the issues or consequences of it might be.

Is there a connection between inhibited emotion and Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease? Is there a "cancer personality"? Questions such as these are emerging as scientific findings throw new light on the controversy that surrounds the mind-body connection in illness and health. Modern research is confirming the age-old wisdom that emotions profoundly affect our physiology. Repressed emotions frequently bring on stress&#x2013;&#x2013; which, in turn, can lead to disease.<p>Provocative and beautifully written, When the Body Says No provides fresh information regarding these and other important issues concerning the effects of stress on health. In lucid, easy-to-follow language, Dr. Gabor Mat� summarizes the latest scientific findings about the role that stress and individual emotional makeup play in an array of diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, irritable bowel syndrome, multiple sclerosis, arthritis, cancer, and ALS, among others. </p><p>Emotions like anger share with our immune system the role of defending our boundaries. When we repress emotions, we may also suppress our immune defenses. In some people, these defenses may go awry, destroying the body rather than protecting it. Dr. Mat� explores the reason why, despite a rapidly accumulating body of evidence about the mind-body unity, most physicians continue to treat physical symptoms rather than persons&#x2013;&#x2013; and why we must understand the mind-body link in order to take an active role in our overall health. </p><p>When the Body Says No promotes learning and healing.

And it was her own personal journey that inspired Elle Luna to write a brief online manifesto that, in a few short months, has touched hundreds of thousands of people who&#x2019;ve read it or heard Elle speak on the topic. Now Ms. Luna expands her ideas into an inspirational, highly visual gift book for every recent graduate, every artist, every seeker, every career changer.<br><br> The Crossroads of Should and Must has a universal message&#x2014;we get to choose the path between Should and Must. And it gives every reader permission to embrace this message. It&#x2019;s about the difference between jobs, careers, and callings. The difference between going to work and becoming one with your work. Why knowing what you want is often the hardest part. It gives eye-opening techniques for reconnecting with one&#x2019;s inner voice, like writing your own obituary (talk about putting life in perspective). It talks about the most common fears of choosing Must over Should&#x2014;money, time, <b>space</b>, and the ultimate fear: total vulnerability&#x2014;and shores up our hesitation with inspiring stories of and quotes from the artists and writers and thinkers who&#x2019;ve faced their own crossroads of Should and Must and taken the leap. It explains the importance of mistakes, of &#x201c;unlearning,&#x201d; of solitude, of keeping moving, of following a soul path.<br><br> Presented in four chapters&#x2014;The Crossroads, The <b>Origin</b> of Should, <b>Must</b>, and The Return&#x2014;inspired by the hero&#x2019;s journey outlined by Joseph Campbell, <b>The Crossroads of Should and Must guides</b> us from the small moment, discovering our Must, to the big moment&#x2014;actually doing something about it, and returning to share our new gifts with the world.<br></p><p>Elle Luna is a designer, painter, and writer. She facilitates a global art movement, #The100DayProject, where creators make every day for 100 days, and has previously worked as a designer at IDEO and with teams on apps and websites, including Medium, Mailbox, and Uber. Ms. Luna speaks to groups around the world sharing the story of <i>The Crossroads of Should and Must</i>. She lives in San Francisco and online at www.instagram.com/elleluna.Publish<br> &nbsp;<br> It was a Tuesday around 7A.M. when I clicked &#x201c;Publish&#x201d; on an essay on Medium.com titled &#x201c;The Crossroads of Should &amp; Must.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> We share things online. Every day. All the time. But something about this thing was different. So different, that in a few short weeks, it was tweeted to over five million people and read by over a quarter million readers.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Drop everything you&#x2019;re doing and read this right now,&#x201d; one woman posted. &#x201c;This article changed my life,&#x201d; wrote another. &#x201c;I was about to send it to all of my employees,&#x201d; wrote one CEO, &#x201c;but I assumed that a third of them would quit if they read it. But you know what? If they don&#x2019;t want to be here, I want them to quit&#x2014;so I sent it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The emails poured in. The tweets lit up my phone. The article spread through the Web in a flash, and then flashed some more. It continued to shine and grow and, well, here we are. I decided to write this book because of the people who shared their stories with me and the pain and courage I felt in their struggle. Women in their thirties. Men in their twenties. A high school senior. Fathers. A widow. Single moms. Millionaires who were poor. Poor people who were millionaires. Teachers. Lawyers. A musician disguised as a lawyer. A poet who loved to drive a city bus. Women who didn&#x2019;t want kids. Fathers who wanted to raise kids. People who felt stuck in their jobs and people who were so desperately grateful to have a job at all.<br> &nbsp;<br> The pain cut across gender, location, and age. And at its essence, the pain was this&#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> All too often, we feel that we are not living the fullness of our lives because we are not expressing the fullness of our gifts.<br> &nbsp;<br> I heard from people who seemed willing to do anything to make their dissatisfaction go away, but they didn&#x2019;t know what to do. I wrote this book to share what I have found most helpful in navigating my own journey, as well as what has been most helpful for the people I met. However, you&#x2019;re not holding a book of answers, because only you know those; you&#x2019;re holding a collection of the most effective questions I encountered along the way. Think of these pages as a series of doorways designed so that you can choose which way your journey will go.<br> &nbsp;<br> These pages are a pep talk to honor that voice inside of you that says you have something special to give. It&#x2019;s a reminder that while there is no map for where you&#x2019;re going, many have traveled this road before. It&#x2019;s permission to unlearn everything you&#x2019;ve ever been told you should do in order to learn what you must.<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s 11:55 a.m. on a Thursday, and I&#x2019;m clicking &#x201c;Save&#x201d; on this document one final time before it begins its adventure into the world. In my own life, I&#x2019;ve found that things appear at the ideal time. Not before. And not after. Consider the possibility that this book made its way into your hands because you wanted it to. Because a part of you has seen a crossroads in your life, and you&#x2019;re ready for the journey ahead. I am humbled and grateful that these words will find their way from me to you, somehow, in some way, at just the right time. Thank you for being a part of this wild and wondrous journey.

As I finish the book, I feel I have succeeded."-George Soros from the Preface<br> <br> Critical praise for Soros on Soros<br> <br> "If you have ever wanted to sit down for a candid conversation with a phenomenal financial success, George Soros's book provides the opportunity. You will meet a complex man and a first-rate mind."-Henry A. Kissinger<br> <br> "The best expert on Soros is undoubtedly George Soros! After all, who is better equipped to tell us what he really thinks and how he thinks, a matter of some importance given the fact that he has translated a remarkable personal financial success into a truly generous and historically significant effort to promote postcommunist democracy." -Zbigniew Brzezinski<br> <br> "The best X-ray of the mind of the master yet." -Barton M. Biggs<br> <br> "George Soros brings a lot more to the world of finance than the intuition and nerve of a born trader-and in Soros on Soros he's no longer bashful about telling us about it. A philosopher at heart, George attributes his success at investing to a theory of the interaction of reality and human perception. What really drives the man now, with a personal fortune beyond all personal need, is a different kind of strategic investing-investment to build in Eastern Europe the kind of open societies he came to value in his own life." -Paul A. Volcker<br> <br> Financial guru George Soros is one of the most colorful and intriguing figures in the financial world today. Now in Soros on Soros, readers are given their most intimate and revealing look yet into the life and mind of the one BusinessWeek dubbed, "The Man Who Moves Markets."<br> <br> Soros on Soros interweaves financial theory and personal reminiscence, political analysis and moral reflection to offer a compelling portrait of the world (and its markets) according to Soros. In an interview-style narrative with Byron Wien, Managing Director at Morgan Stanley, and with German journalist Krisztina Koenen, Soros vividly describes the genesis of his brilliant financial career and shares his views on investing and global finance, politics and the emerging world order, and the responsibility of power.<br> <br> Speaking with remarkable candor, he traces his progress from Holocaust survivor to philosophy student, unsuccessful tobacco salesman to the world's most powerful and profitable trader and introduces us to the people and events that helped shape his character and his often controversial views.<br> <br> In describing the investment theories and financial strategies that have made him "a superstar among money managers" (The New York Times), Soros tells the fascinating story of the phenomenally successful Soros Fund Management and its $12 billion flagship, Quantum Fund. He also offers fresh insights into some of his most sensational wins and losses, including a firsthand account of the $1 billion he made going up against the British pound and the fortune he lost speculating on the yen. Plus: Soros's take on the devaluation of the peso and currency fluctuations internationally.<br> <br> He tells of the personal and professional crises that more than once threatened to destroy him and of the personal resources he drew upon to turn defeat into resounding victory. And he explains his motivations for establishing the Soros Foundation and the Open Society Institute through which he worked to build open societies in postcommunist countries in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.<br> <br> Finally, turning his attention to international politics, Soros offers keen insights into the current state of affairs in Russia and the former communist bloc countries and analyzes the reasons behind and likely consequences of the West's failure to properly integrate them into the free world. He also explores the crisis of the ERM and analyzes the pros and cons of investing in a number of emerging markets.<br> <br> Find out what makes one of the greatest financial wizards of this or any age tick. Soros on Soros is a must read for anyone interested in world finance and international policy.</p><p>GEORGE SOROS runs Soros Fund Management, the principal investment advisor to Quantum Group of Funds, a series of off-shore investment funds. Its flagship, Quantum Fund NV, is generally recognized as having the best performance record of any investment fund in the world during its 26-year history. In addition to being a renowned financier, George Soros has established a network of foundations operating in 25 countries and spending hundreds of millions of dollars annually on major philanthropic efforts. George Soros&#39;s other books include The Alchemy of Finance, Opening the Soviet System, and Underwriting Democracy.Hungarian-born investor Soros, already well known for the unmatched success of his Quantum Fund, achieved additional notoriety in 1992 when he amassed over $1 billion in profits with the collapse of the British pound. He is also recognized for his philanthropic activities, having established foundations in several Eastern European nations. Soros on Soros is a book-length interview, conducted by the managing director of Morgan Stanley and a Hungarian journalist. Its scope reaches far beyond the topic of investing and includes Soros's responses to questions about life influences, philanthropy, international politics, and philosophy. The book should be a hit with those wanting an in-depth look into the mind of the master investor, but the interview format does not allow for the broadest coverage. Reporter and biographer Slater's Soros is better suited for those approaching the subject for the first time. Slater's presentation is balanced and well organized, and he succeeds at providing clear, concise summaries of Soros's sometimes confusing ideas and theories. Both titles would make good additions to business collections.?Mark McCullough, Heterick Lib., Ohio Northern Univ., Ada<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Click Here to Kill Everybody: Security and Survival in a Hyper-connected World</h2><p><p><strong>A world of "smart" devices means the Internet can kill people.

Imagine being sealed into a closed environment for two years &#x2014; cut off from the outside world with only seven other people &#x2014; enduring never-ending hunger, severely low levels of oxygen, and extremely difficult relationships. Crew members struggled to survive in Biosphere 2, where they swore nothing would go in or out &#x2014; no food or water, not even air &#x2014; all in the name of science. For the first time, biospherian Jane Poynter &#x2014; who lived and loved in the Biosphere &#x2014; is ready to share what really happened in there. She takes readers on a riveting, fast-paced trip through shattered lives, scientific discovery, cults, love, fears of insanity, and inspiring human endurance. The eight biospherians who closed themselves into the Biosphere emerged 730 days later... much wiser, thinner, and having done what many had said was impossible.</p><p>JANE POYNTER is an adventurer whose participation in Biosphere 2 involved training in survival techniques in the Australian outback and sailing a ferro-cement boat in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. She was the only member of the Biosphere crew to be fired three times (and reinstated three times). While inside, she and her husband-to-be, fellow crew member Taber McCallum, not only arranged to have a house built for themselves, but began a space technology firm, Paragon Space Development Corporation. She has designed and built experiments that have ridden in the International Space Station and had three more on the ill-fated Columbia mission. In addition to writing this book, she and Paragon are developing life support systems for the space shuttle and for Navy deep-sea divers.

I stood in my prickly blue jumpsuit with the other seven inmates of the Bubble, as some of us liked to call it. We waited for the radio announcement that it was time to walk through the double-doored airlock, that the mission was finally over. I would like to say that I was pondering heady thoughts about the future of mankind, but all I could think of was how much I wished that dear Jane Goodall would shut up. I have the deepest respect for my fellow countrywoman who has dedicated her life to the study and conservation of chimpanzees, taught us that apes use tools and laugh, too, and caused us to redefine what it is that makes us human. But as Jane gave the keynote speech leading to our re-entry into the world, into what we called Biosphere 1, the minutes ticked by with agonizing slowness. <p>"Come on, people," I muttered to myself. "I signed up for two years&#x2014;not two years and one minute, or two minutes. Only two years." </p><p>Eight ten. "Jane, let us apes out of the cage!" </p><p>Eight fifteen. </p><p>Finally, some screeching over the radio told us to scurry to the heavy metal airlock fashioned out of submarine bulkheads years earlier. It was eight twenty. We stepped in, the door swinging closed behind us with the bang and scrape of the closure mechanism, and the outer door opened. </p><p>One by one, we stepped out of our simple life of milking goats and weeding the garden, of weather reports that included&#x2014;along with temperature and humidity readings&#x2014;the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide. We left the daily struggle with tedium and discord, and stepped into applause, a trumpeted fanfare, cheering, a sea of cameras, backslaps, and handshakes. </p><p>For the first time in two years and twenty minutes, I inhaled the view of the bright desert sky with no white bars dissecting it into geometric patterns. The air seemed thin, insipid, not the thick atmosphere redolent with molecules from plants, fungi, animals&#x2014;the pungent, pleasant, and unmistakable earthy fragrance of Biosphere 2. </p><p>Since September 26, 1991 the eight of us had risked much to live as if on Mars, farming all our food, recycling our water, our waste, and even the oxygen we breathed in our hermetically sealed 3.15-acre world. The rainforest, savannah, desert, ocean, and marsh had been our in-vitro test subjects for ecological research. But the glass and steel structure made a pressure cooker, our human foibles boiling to the surface in what some named the Human Experiment. </p><p>Now ten years have smoothed the searing anger I felt upon completing our mission. I can at last recall and assess the controversy and all that occurred in and around our New Age Garden of Eden, aided by the many people I have interviewed and the records I have read, with what approximates objectivity. I want to tell this extraordinary adventure tale of a colorful band of mavericks attempting what many said was impossible to set the record straight, to halt the maelstrom of misinformation that still swirls around the project. </p><p>Even now, when I open boxes containing books and clothing I had with me during my sojourn, the smell emanating from the brown cardboard transports me instantaneously back inside...</p></p><h2>Rimbaud: Complete Works, Selected Letters, a Bilingual Edition</h2><p>The <i>enfant terrible</i> of French letters, Jean-Nicholas-Arthur Rimbaud (1854-91)&nbsp;was a defiant and precocious youth who wrote some of the most remarkable prose and poetry of the nineteenth century, all before leaving the world of verse by the age of twenty-one. More than a century after his death, the young rebel-poet continues to appeal to modern readers as much for his turbulent life as for his poetry; his stormy affair with fellow poet Paul Verlaine and his nomadic adventures in eastern Africa are as iconic as his hallucinatory poems and symbolist prose. <br><br>The first translation of the poet's complete works when it was published in 1966, <i>Rimbaud: Complete Works, Selected Letters</i> introduced a new generation of Americans to the alienated genius&#x2014;among them the Doors's lead singer Jim Morrison, who wrote to translator Wallace Fowlie to thank him for rendering the poems accessible to those who "don't read French that easily." Forty years later, the book remains the only side-by-side bilingual edition of Rimbaud's complete poetic works. <br><br>Thoroughly revising Fowlie's edition, Seth Whidden has made changes on virtually every page, correcting errors, reordering poems, adding previously omitted versions of poems and some letters, and updating the text to reflect current scholarship; left in place are Fowlie's literal and respectful translations of Rimbaud's complex and nontraditional verse. Whidden also provides a foreword that considers the heritage of Fowlie's edition and adds a bibliography that acknowledges relevant books that have appeared since the original publication. On its fortieth anniversary, <i>Rimbaud</i> remains the most authoritative&#x2014;and now, completely up-to-date&#x2014;edition of the young master's entire poetic ouvre.</p><p><b>Seth Whidden</b> is professor of French at the University of Oxford and editor of <i>Nineteenth-Century French Studies</i>. He is the author of <i>Leaving Parnassus: The Lyric Subject in Verlaine and Rimbaud</i> and <i>Authority in Crisis in French Literature, 1850&#x2013;1880</i>. For ten years&nbsp;he served as coeditor of <i>Parade savage</i>,&nbsp;the scholarly journal of Rimbaud studies.&#34;This handsome edition, which makes France&#39;s most remarkable poet readily available in the U.S., may well be a literary landmark comparable to Baudelaire&#39;s introduction of Edgar Allan Poe in France a century earlier.&#34; - Anna Balakian, New York Times Book Review&#34;</p><h2>Goya: Order &amp; Disorder</h2><p>Francisco Goya has been widely celebrated as the most important Spanish artist of the late-eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the last of the old masters and the first of the moderns, and an astute observer of the human condition in all its complexity. The many-layered and shifting meanings of his work have made him one of the most studied artists in the world. Few, however, have made the ambitious attempt to explore his work as a painter, printmaker and draftsman across media and the timeline of his life. This book does just that, presenting a comprehensive and integrated view of Goya's most important paintings, prints, and drawings through the themes and imagery that continually challenged or preoccupied the artist. They reveal how he strove relentlessly to understand and describe human behavior and emotional states, even at their most orderly or disorderly extremes, in elegant and incisive portraits, dramatic and monumental history paintings, and series of prints and drawings of a satirical, disturbing and surreal nature. Derived from the research for the largest Goya art exhibition in North America in a quarter-century, this book takes a fresh look at one of the greatest artists in history by examining the fertile territory between the two poles that defined the range of his boundlessly creative personality.<br><br><b>Francisco Jos� Goya y Lucientes</b> (1746&#x2013;1828) was born in Fuendetodos, Arag�n, in the northeast of Spain. Goya was court painter to the Spanish Crown, and famously documented the Peninsular War (1807&#x2013;1814) between France and Spain in his harrowing <i>Disasters of War</i> series. An important bridge to the modernist era, Goya's oeuvre provided a crucial precedent for artists such as Manet, Picasso and Francis Bacon.</p><p>Goya: Order &amp; Disorder automatically invites comparisons with Goya and the Spirit of Enlightenment, a volume produced a quarter century ago, when MFA Boston last presented a major Goya exhibition. The new book&#x2019;s title suggests a historical approach to its subject&#x2013;like the earlier volume&#x2019;s&#x2013;reflecting the massive changes in Spain and Europe during Goya&#x2019;s lifetime. Instead, it delivers a thematic, historically untethered account of Goya&#x2019;s achievement, making it hard to grasp how a young, savvy striver&#x2013;many of whose commissioned works of the 1770s and early 1780s are underwhelming&#x2013;evolved into the artist who created the bitingly satirical Caprichos in the late 1790s, who responded to Spain&#x2019;s brutal guerrilla war against French invaders with some of the most indelible images in Western art, and whose late work foreshadows, in the words of Fred Licht, the &#x201c;modern temper in art.&#x201d; Goya and the Spirit of Enlightenment presents Goya&#x2019;s oeuvre in three chronological segments that segregate prints and drawings, which are uniquely important in Goya&#x2019;s oeuvre. The effect is to show the artist&#x2019;s transformation from a creature of the Age of Reason into a harbinger of our darker time. But the present book, organized thematically, scrambles the chronology of Goya&#x2019;s career, so that works with quite different audiences and aims (noble portrait versus piercing social critique) appear cheek by jowl. Gathered under the theme &#x201c;Hunting&#x201d; are anodyne early tapestry cartoons; an unintentionally comic print copying a royal portrait by Vel�zquez, whose subject poses as a hunter; and, from Los Caprichos, the print All Will Fall, in which bird men, lured by a beautiful harpy, are ensnared and tortured by women with evident relish, an image that crosses the line between moralizing allegory and penetrating psychology.

The authors of this book do; and in doing so, they provoke the reader to consider style, not as an elegant accessory of effective prose, but as its very heart.</p><p>At a time when writing skills have virtually disappeared, what can be done? If only people learned the principles of verbal correctness, the essential rules, wouldn't good prose simply fall into place? Thomas and Turner say no. Attending to rules of grammar, sense, and sentence structure will no more lead to effective prose than knowing the mechanics of a golf swing will lead to a hole-in-one. Furthermore, ten-step programs to better writing exacerbate the problem by failing to recognize, as Thomas and Turner point out, that there are many styles with different standards.</p><p>In the first half of <i>Clear and Simple,</i> the authors introduce a range of styles--reflexive, practical, plain, contemplative, romantic, prophetic, and others--contrasting them to classic style. Its principles are simple: The writer adopts the pose that the motive is truth, the purpose is presentation, the reader is an intellectual equal, and the occasion is informal. Classic style is at home in everything from business memos to personal letters, from magazine articles to university writing.</p><p>The second half of the book is a tour of examples--the exquisite and the execrable--showing what has worked and what hasn't. Classic prose is found everywhere: from Thomas Jefferson to Junichir&#x14d; Tanizaki, from Mark Twain to the observations of an undergraduate. Here are many fine performances in classic style, each clear and simple as the truth.</p><p>Originally published in 1994.</p><p>The <b>Princeton Legacy Library</b> uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press. These editions preserve the original texts of these important books while presenting them in durable paperback and hardcover editions. The goal of the Princeton Legacy Library is to vastly increase access to the rich scholarly heritage found in the thousands of books published by Princeton University Press since its founding in 1905.</p></p><p>These days, discussions of writing style are generally limited to superficialities such as serial commas and approved abbreviations. It's a pity. While consistency in writing does make for more pleasant reading, no amount of rule-abiding can mask poorly wrought prose. In <i>Clear and Simple As the Truth</i>, Francis-No�l Thomas and Mark Turner argue that "writing is an intellectual activity, not a bundle of skills." The first half of their book is a probing examination of classic style, the form popularized by 17th-century French prose writers such as Descartes, Pascal, and Madame de S�vign� and best typified contemporarily by much of the writing in the pre-1985 <i>New Yorker</i>. The authors liken classic style to those theorems in mathematics valued for being "brief, efficient, clear, elegant, and pure." The classic sentence appears effortless, "as if it could have been written in no other way," and while "the writer may speak with a technical mastery not possessed by the reader ... his attitude is always that the reader lacks this mastery only accidentally." While one can hardly hope to distill the essence of classic style into a sentence, Thomas and Turner describe it most succinctly as expression that is "clear and simple as the truth, but no clearer or simpler." <p> The second half of the book is a "museum" of classic prose, by Thomas Jefferson, Descartes, Jane Austen, Mark Twain, Richard Feynman, Oscar Wilde, Philip Larkin, and many others, accompanied by commentary from the authors.</p>A free on-line instructor's guide for using <i>Clear and Simple as the Truth</i> in the classroom is available at http://www.wam.umd.edu/~mturn/WWW/csguide.html.</p><h2>A Peterson Field Guide To Western Trees: Western United States and Canada (Peterson Field Guides)</h2><p>This newly designed edition of a popular Peterson Field Guide features detailed descriptions of 387 species, arranged in six major groups by visual similarity.

The authors chart every stage of research, from finding a topic and generating research questions about it to marshalling evidence, constructing arguments, and writing everything up in a final report that is a model of authority. Their advice is designed for use by both beginners and seasoned practitioners, and for projects from class papers to dissertations.<br><br>This book is organized into four parts. Part One is a spirited introduction to the distinctive nature, values, and protocols of research. Part Two demystifies the art of discovering a topic. It outlines a wide range of sources, among them personal interests and passions. Parts Three and Four cover the essentials of argument&#x2014;how to make a claim and support it&#x2014;and ways to outline, draft, revise, rewrite, and polish the final report. Part Three is a short course in the logic, structure, uses, and common pitfalls of argumentation. The writing chapters in Part Four show how to present verbal and visual information effectively and how to shape sentences and paragraphs that communicate with power and precision.<br><br>"A well-constructed, articulate reminder of how important fundamental questions of style and approach, such as clarity and precision, are to all research."&#x2014;<i>Times Literary Supplement</i></p><p>Skillfully done, research can be the solid cornerstone of your term paper (or dissertation, essay, or article); inadequately executed, it can cause your whole project to crumble and fall. Yet essential as research is to the ultimate success of your work, performing it is not an innate talent. The precepts, steps, and skills of solid research are readily acquired if you spend some time with <i>The Craft of Research</i> before you start on your outlines and thesis statements. Written by three distinguished professors in 1995, published by the University of Chicago, and winner of the 1995-96 Critics' Choice Award, <i>The Craft of Research</i> teaches how to plan, carry out, and report on research for any field and at any level. Aimed at assisting student researchers, from raw beginners to accomplished graduate and professional students, the book shows how to choose a topic, plan and organize research, and how to draft and revise a report of findings such that a convincing solution is offered to a significant problem.<p> <i>The Craft of Research</i> is more than just another instruction manual getting you from topic to outline to notes to report. Recognizing that good research is rarely a simple, sequential procedure, but is instead a complex and intricate process, it discusses the subtle ways in which asking questions about your topic can influence how you draft your report, how a quality introduction can send you back to the library, and how the process of drafting can highlight flaws in your argument that need to be addressed. Clear and explicit, sophisticated and practical, <i>The Craft of Research</i> encourages high standards of scholarly achievement, and spells out the steps by which to get there. <i>--Stephanie Gold</i></p>Since 1995, more than 150,000 students and researchers have turned to <i>The Craft of Research</i> for clear and helpful guidance on how to conduct research and report it effectively . Now, master teachers Wayne C. Booth, Gregory G. Colomb, and Joseph M. Williams present a completely revised and updated version of their classic handbook.<br><br>Like its predecessor, this new edition reflects the way researchers actually work: in a complex circuit of thinking, writing, revising, and rethinking. It shows how each part of this process influences the others and how a successful research report is an orchestrated conversation between a researcher and a reader. Along with many other topics, <i>The Craft of Research</i> explains how to build an argument that motivates readers to accept a claim; how to anticipate the reservations of thoughtful yet critical readers and to respond to them appropriately; and how to create introductions and conclusions that answer that most demanding question, "So what?"<br><br>Celebrated by reviewers for its logic and clarity, this popular book retains its five-part structure. Part 1 provides an orientation to the research process and begins the discussion of what motivates researchers and their readers. Part 2 focuses on finding a topic, planning the project, and locating appropriate sources. This section is brought up to date with new information on the role of the Internet in research, including how to find and evaluate sources, avoid their misuse, and test their reliability.<br><br>Part 3 explains the art of making an argument and supporting it. The authors have extensively revised this section to present the structure of an argument in clearer and more accessible terms than in the first edition. New distinctions are made among <i>reasons</i>, <i>evidence</i>, and <i>reports of evidence</i>. The concepts of <i>qualifications and rebuttals</i> are recast as <i>acknowledgment and response</i>. Part 4 covers drafting and revising, and offers new information on the visual representation of data. Part 5 concludes the book with an updated discussion of the ethics of research, as well as an expanded bibliography that includes many electronic sources.<br><br>The new edition retains the accessibility, insights, and directness that have made <i>The Craft of Research</i> an indispensable guide for anyone doing research, from students in high school through advanced graduate study to businesspeople and government employees. The authors demonstrate convincingly that researching and reporting skills can be learned and used by all who undertake research projects.<br><br>New to this edition:<br><br>Extensive coverage of how to do research on the internet, including how to evaluate and test the reliability of sources<br><br>New information on the visual representation of data<br><br>Expanded bibliography with many electronic sources</p><h2>MCAT General Chemistry Review, 3rd Edition (Graduate School Test Preparation)</h2><p><b>IF IT'S ON THE TEST, IT'S IN THIS BOOK.

Extensive fieldwork in both Africa and the United States convinced Allan Savory that neither the forces of nature nor commonly blamed culprits -- overpopulation, poor farming practices, lack of financial support -- were causing the decline of once-healthy ecosystems. He also noted that once land has become degraded, leaving it alone seldom helps revitalize it. Savory eventually came to realize that on the most fundamental level, environmental problems are caused by human management decisions, and only through wholesale changes in the way decisions are made can functioning ecosystems be restored. In response to that startling discovery, Savory began to develop a revolutionary new approach to decision-making and management. Known initially as Holistic Resource Management, and now as simply Holistic Management, it considers humans, their economies, and the environment as inseparable. It includes a common-sense decision-making framework that requires no specialized knowledge or elaborate technology to utilize, and is applicable in any environment or management situation. At the heart of the approach lies a simple testing process that enables people to make decisions that simultaneously consider economic, social, and environmental realities, both short- and long-term.<i>Holistic Management</i> is a newly revised and updated edition of <i>Holistic Resource Management</i> (Island Press, 1988), which was the first book-length treatment of Savory's decision-making framework and how it could be applied. A decade of trial-and-error implementation has strengthened and clarified the book's ideas, and has expanded the scope of the process to include all manner of decisions and management situations, not just those that relate to land and resource management.<i>Holistic Management</i> has been practiced by thousands of people around the world to profitably restore and promote the health of their land through practices that mimic nature, and by many others who have sought a more rewarding personal or family life. This book is an essential handbook for anyone involved with land management and stewardship -- ranchers, farmers, resource managers, and others -- and a valuable guide for all those seeking to make better decisions within their organizations or in any aspect of their personal lives.</p><p>Allan Savory is cofounder and president of the Savory Institute. Born in Zimbabwe and educated as an ecologist with degrees in zoology and botany, Savory has had a decades-long career in African and Middle Eastern government and politics, private consultancy, and teaching. His work in resource management started in the mid-1960s in an effort to find workable solutions ordinary people could implement to restore degraded lands. He and his wife, Jody Butterfield continue those efforts today, reaching a global audience through the efforts of the Savory Institute.<br><br><b>Jody Butterfield</b> cofounded the Savory Institute with her husband Allan Savory and collaborates with him on books, articles, and papers on holistic management approaches to restoring health to the world's degraded grasslands.

The Complete Works</h2><p><p>A bird-monster devouring sinners, naked bodies in tantric contortions, a pair of ears brandishing a sharpened blade: with nightmarish details and fantastical painterly schemes, Netherlandish visionary Hieronymus Bosch (c. 1450&#x2013;1516) secured his place as an art historical magnet. Five hundred years on from his death, his extraordinary works continue to enthrall scholars, artists, designers, and musicians.</p><p>This large-scale TASCHEN monograph presents the complete Bosch oeuvre, celebrating the artist&#x2019;s staggering compositional scope and most bizarre and intricate details through full-page reproductions, abundant details, and a fold-out spread drawn from The Last Judgement. With guidance from art historian and Bosch expert Stefan Fischer, we explore the many compelling elements that populate each scene, from hybrid creatures of man and beast, to painterly assaults on the body, and a pictorial use of proverbs and idioms. Particular attention is given to Bosch&#x2019;s most famous work, the mesmerizing, terrifying triptych The Garden of Earthly Delights.</p></p><p>Stefan Fischer studied art history, history, and classical archaeology in M�nster, Amsterdam, and Bonn. In 2009 he completed his doctoral thesis &#x201c;Hieronymus Bosch: Malerei als Vision, Lehrbild und Kunstwerk.&#x201d; His specialist fields are Netherlandish painting of the 15th to the 17th centuries and museology.&#x201c;Superb color reproductions and numerous details allow us to examine Bosch&#x2019;s fantastic imagery with a clarity seldom possible, even in a museum gallery.&#x201d;</p><h2>Moment Work: Tectonic Theater Project&#39;s Process of Devising Theater</h2><p><b>A detailed guide to the collaborative method developed by the acclaimed creators of <i>The Laramie Project</i> and <i>Gross Indecency</i>--destined to become a classic. A Vintage Original.</b><br><br>By Mois�s Kaufman and Barbara Pitts McAdams with Leigh Fondakowski, Andy Paris, Greg Pierotti, Kelli Simpkins, Jimmy Maize, and Scott Barrow.

I&#x2019;m fascinated by what&#x2019;s possible on stage, and by the myriad ways we can create theatrical narratives that generate riveting and profoundly intimate dialogues with an audience. It is this sense of awe and curiosity that led me to found the laboratory that is now Tectonic Theater Project.<br>&nbsp;<br>Growing up in Venezuela, I had the good fortune of seeing the work of artists such as Peter Brook, Pina Bausch, Jerzy Grotowski, and Tadeusz Kantor at Caracas&#x2019;s world-class inter�national theater festival. These artists were rigorously explor�ing the potential of the stage. They created strange and wonderful new worlds that could exist only on the stage. Every aspect of these productions&#x2014;sets, acting, sound, movement&#x2014;helped build a new reality. Their work was experimental, ad�venturous, and very theatrical.<br>&nbsp;<br>I was so used to these experimental works that when I saw my first &#x201c;realistic&#x201d; play, I thought, &#x201c;This is so avant-garde! Look, there&#x2019;s a sofa onstage! And water comes out of that faucet!&#x201d; I guess my reaction must have been similar to that of the audi�ence in Moscow in 1896, when <i>The Seagull </i>premiered. For them (as for me), naturalism was a new form that broke with all prevailing theatrical conventions. And because of the new�ness of that form (Masha sitting with her back to the audience, sounds of birds and horse carriages in the distance!), the audi�ence was invited (or <i>forced</i>) to experience the content of the piece in a different way. Chekhov&#x2019;s words were given a new canvas on which they could communicate with that audience.<br>&nbsp;<br>This early exposure to a broad range of theatrical vocabular�ies ignited my curiosity and gave me a hunger for experimenta�tion that has never left me.<br>&nbsp;<br>Tom Stoppard once described an outdoor production of <i>The Tempest </i>that had become almost legendary among those who&#x2019;d seen it. In Act V, Scene I, just after Prospero grants the spirit Ariel his freedom, Shakespeare writes, &#x201c;<i>Exit Ariel.</i>&#x201d; The produc�tion Stoppard describes was performed on an outdoor stage, near a lake. After Prospero bade Ariel farewell, the spirit ran across the stage straight into the lake, where to everyone&#x2019;s sur�prise he continued to run on the surface of the water (the set designer had built a walkway in the water invisible to the audi�ence). The audience saw Ariel running across the lake, and as he disappeared into the darkness of the oncoming evening, fire�works erupted into the air from the far shore. When the sparks were gone, so was Ariel.<br>&nbsp;<br>I can&#x2019;t help but think of the enormous awe and delight ex�perienced by the audience. These theater artists had figured out a way to capture the magical and ethereal essence of the character and express it theatrically: Ariel&#x2014; a spirit&#x2014;defying the laws of physics and then exploding into a blazing fire! Fur�thermore, by having him disappear in the distance just as the fireworks burst, they had used the audience&#x2019;s imagination to create a metamorphosis. This combination of theatricality and ingenuity had not only managed to articulate a sophisticated idea onstage but also to dazzle the audience and generate a sense of awe.<br>&nbsp;<br>Theater as an art form has such magnificent potential! And <i>theatricality </i>as a language is endless in its ability to address the audience&#x2019;s imaginations, minds, and feelings.<br>&nbsp;<br>So why is it that much of the work we see on contemporary stages makes little use of that full potential? Why is it that so much of the work we see onstage takes place in living rooms or kitchens? Why, in a time when film, television, and the Internet continue to redefine what can happen on a screen, are natural�ism and realism still so prevalent as narrative styles onstage? Today we as a society are constantly exposed to narrative. We have become incredibly adept both at evaluating aesthetics and at interpreting narratives within them. So why do we continue to use the same well-known forms to talk about new ideas? If we want to tell stories on the stage, how can we do so in a way that uses all the magnificence, the poetry, and the idiosyncratic discursive power of that which is theatrical? Which theatrical vocabularies and languages will <i>best </i>allow the stage to express contemporary narratives?<br>&nbsp;<br>These questions were with us in the rehearsal room as we started the company, and I am still contemplating them more than twenty years later. Our name, Tectonic, refers to the art and science of structure&#x2014; as in archi<i>tecture</i>, archi<i>tectonic</i>. We wanted to focus on form and on how that form relates to the narratives we construct. (<i>Tectonic </i>also refers to the movements of large continental plates, and this idea of shaking things up appealed to our youthful bravado.)<br><br>Our first years as a company were devoted to staging authors who were themselves experimenting with new theatrical vocabularies. During that time, Moment Work began to emerge as a series of exercises that allowed us to pursue the full potential of their plays using a new, shared language. It was Moment Work that would eventually lead us to create our own plays, and it is Moment Work that has led us to write this book. <br><br>I once visited Argentina to give a lecture at the Teatro Colon, a magnificent nineteenth-century theater that was modeled on La Scala in Milan and the Paris Opera House. While touring it, I noticed that on either side of the audience seats the walls were made of metal grills that resembled vents, which seemed odd to me because the theater was built before the invention of air conditioning. I asked the artistic director about them, and what he said really struck me. <br><br>Around the turn of the twentieth century, when the theater was built, widows were not supposed to be seen at social events for a year after their husbands died. To work around this ridiculous social restriction, the theater's owners and architects decided to build rooms on either side of the audience behind the grilles in the walls where the widows could come to see plays without being seen themselves. I was deeply moved by this: it showed how much that society valued our art form and how important they thought it was for people in times of strife. <br><br>When I look back at Tectonic&#x2019;s work over the past two decades, I think the one question that has consistently given us focus and driven our work is this: how do we articulate a vision for this art form today that will allow theater to secure that vital role in our culture?<br><br><i>Mois�s Kaufman</i><br><i>May 2017</i></p><h2>Dud Avocado</h2><p>&#39;One of the funniest books I&#39;ve ever read&#39; - Gore Vidal * The Dud Avocado gained instant cult status on first publication and remains a timeless portrait of a woman hellbent on living.

Based on the fable of the man who traded his soul for superhuman powers and knowledge, it became the life&#39;s work of Germany&#39;s greatest poet. Beginning with an intriguing wager between God and Satan, it charts the life of a deeply flawed individual, his struggle against the nihilism of his diabolical companion Mephistopheles. Part One presents Faust&#39;s pact with the Devil and the harrowing tragedy of his love affair with the young Gretchen. Part Two shows Faust&#39;s experience in the world of public affairs, including his encounter with Helen of Troy, the emblem of classical beauty and culture. The whole is a symbolic and panoramic commentary on the human condition and on modern European history and civilisation. This new translation of both parts of Faust preserves the poetic character of the original, its tragic pathos and hilarious comedy. In addition, John Williams has translated the Urfaust, a fascinating glimpse into the young Goethe&#39;s imagination, and a selection from the draft scenarios for the Walpurgis Night witches&#39; sabbath - material so ribald and blasphemous that Goethe did not dare publish it.</p><p></p><h2>Principles of Cost Accounting</h2><p>Discover how readable and relevant cost accounting can be with PRINCIPLES OF COST ACCOUNTING, 17E.

Written between 1932 and 1940, Blanchot&#39;s first novel, here brilliantly translated by Robert Lamberton, contains all the remarkable aspects of his famous and perplexing invention, the ontological narrative--a tale whose subject is the nature of being itself. This paradoxical work discovers being in the absence of being, mystery in the absence of mystery, both to be searched for limitlessly. As Blanchot launches this endless search in his own masterful way, he transforms the possibilities of the novel. First issued in English in 1973 in a limited edition, this re-issue includes an illuminating essay on translation by Lamberton.</p><p><b>Maurice Blanchot</b>&nbsp;is one of the most enigmatic and influential figures in modern French writing yet no interview, no biographical sketch, and hardly any photographs have ever been published of him.

But when abstract concepts are introduced, students often hit a &#34;brick wall.&#34; Instructors seem to agree that certain concepts (such as linear independence, spanning, subspace, vector space, and linear transformations), are not easily understood, and require time to assimilate. Since they are fundamental to the study of linear algebra, students&#39; understanding of these concepts is vital to their mastery of the subject. Lay introduces these concepts early in a familiar, concrete Rn setting, develops them gradually, and returns to them again and again throughout the text. Finally, when discussed in the abstract, these concepts are more accessible. Students&#39; conceptual understanding is reinforced through True/False questions, practice problems, and the use of technology. David Lay changed the face of linear algebra with the execution of this philosophy, and continues his quest to improve the way linear algebra is taught with the new Updated Second Edition. With this update, he builds on this philosophy through increased visualization in the text, vastly enhanced technology support, and an extensive instructor support package. He has added additional figures to the text to help students visualize abstract concepts at key points in the course. A new dedicated CD and Website further enhance the course materials by providing additional support to help students gain command of difficult concepts. The CD, included in the back of the book, contains a wealth of new materials, with a registration coupon allowing access to a password-protected Website. These new materials are tied directly to the text, providing a comprehensive package for teaching and learning linear algebra.</p><p><p><b>David C.

Its conversational and positive tone keeps readers interested in the subject matter, as it encourages them to apply the concepts of the book to their own lives. <b></b> It presents research findings, theories, and models from the fields of developmental psychology, social psychology, health psychology, sociology, and others to discuss topics of prevention, compensation, gains, and losses. <b></b> For psychologists, sociologists, and gerontologists interested in a valuable resource for information about the aging process.</p><p>Using a personal, conversational style -- and an exceptionally well-balanced blend of research, theory, and practical applications -- this text explores the ways in which adults change or develop in both shared and individual ways over the full range of adult years -- from 18 to 100 or more. Comprehensive in scope, it explores all aspects of the process of development -- physical, cognitive, social, personality, and spiritual development -- and the biological, psychological, or social forces or laws that may govern the changes we see among adults.<p><b>AN OPENING NOTE FROM BARBARA BJORKLUND</b></p> <p> <i>The Journey of Adulthood</i> is now in its fifth edition and it continues to capture the dynamic process of adult development, from young adulthood to old, old age. It continues to be based on large-scale research findings and theories of human development, but because diversity increases with age, I have also included more studies of smaller group differences such as gender, culture, race, and socialeconomic status. I have sought a similar balance in seeking out the latest research findings while retaining some of the classical studies by pioneers in the field. And I have accompanied this sometimes medicinal taste with a spoonful of honey&#x2014;a little personal warmth and humor. After all, I am an adult in the middle years of this journey, following my parents who are in their 80s and looking back at my children in their 30s. </p> <p> The first three editions of this book were written by Helen Bee and although she has retired and is no longer involved in the 4th and 5th editions, the core of the book is still hers. She remains the author emeritus of this series and I maintain her focus and tone. I have also retained some of her comments and stories which I identify with her name; the comments and stories that use the first person "I," are mine. I hope there is no confusion. </p> <p> The first two chapters of this book contain the basics for the course&#x2014;the definitions, methods, and grand theories of adult development. They lay the groundwork for the following chapters which present a topical overview of adult development. In each of these seven chapters, I cover a topic of adult development using recent research, classic studies, current theories, new directions, and practical applications. In the last five chapters I present some topics that are not as easily classified into traditional fields of study but instead draw upon a number of areas covered in the previous chapters, such as the growth of meaning, the stress encountered at different stages of adulthood, overall views of adult development, and coping with death. In these chapters, to use Helen Bee's terms, "I try to pull the threads together and tie up loose ends." </p> <p><b>NEW IN THIS EDITION</b></p> <p> The fifth edition reflects three types of changes&#x2014;changes in the field of adult development, changes in the world around us, and changes in the academic settings in which this book is used. </p> <p><b>Changes in the Field of Adult Development</b></p> <p> The field of adult development has widened and this edition reflects this trend, including information from various medical and biological sciences, sociology and social psychology, women's studies, economics, educational and vocational psychology, anthropology, and clinical psychology, just to name a few, I have found common ground among these disciplines and when discrepancies appear, I have made judgments or suggested future research questions. Another change in the field that is reflected in this edition of <i>The Journey of Adulthood</i> is the international flavor that most sciences are adopting. This book features many studies conducted by international scholars and information about populations outside the U.S. I have also done some fine tuning in terminology and definitions which aligns this book more closely to recent changes in child and adolescent development writings. </p> <p><b>Changes in the World Around Us</b></p> <p> The world around us has changed drastically since the last edition of this book. As I write this preface, we in the U.S. are at "level orange" on the homeland security scale. We have just ended a war with Iraq and have started to rebuild that country. The horror of September 11 th, 2001 is still fresh in our minds. The economy is in a slump all over the world and many older adults have seen their investments dwindle to a fraction of their value five years ago. Many middle-aged adults have abandoned plans for early retirement. Although I try to maintain a positive tone in this book, these aspects of life are reality and I have considered them in selecting new topics to cover. </p> <p> Other changes in the world are more positive, such as the increase in volunteer work among older adults, the strengthening of family bonds, the progress of women in the workplace, the progress in reversing some aspects of physical aging (and preventing others), and the overall news that aging is not nearly as bad as it was thought to be just a decade ago. All these are addressed in this edition of <i>The Journey of Adulthood.</i> </p> <p><b>Changes in the Classroom Environment</b></p> <p> Courses in adult development and aging have increased in number and are being offered at almost all colleges and universities. It is safe to say that graduates in almost all majors will be working in fields that deal with the changes that occur during adulthood. It is also safe to say that students in all majors will be dealing with the topic on a personal level, either with their family members or themselves. My students at Florida Atlantic University this semester are majoring in psychology, counseling, communications, nursing, pre-medical studies, pre-law, finance, social work, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and education. I no longer assume that my students will have the same basic knowledge of psychology that students had a decade ago. For that reason I include basic definitions of key terms in this book, clear explanations of relevant statistical methods, and details of classic theories. I meet the readers without assumptions of their backgrounds, but with respect for their intelligence and motivation. I firmly believe that it is possible to write clearly about complex ideas, and I follow Helen Bee in this tradition. </p> <p><b>HIGHLIGHTS OF CHANGES AND ADDITIONS</b></p> <p> Research and theories have been updated throughout the book. More emphasis has been placed on <b>positive aspects of adult development</b> such as long-term marriages, contribution of elders to other generations, benefits of a healthy lifestyle to physical and cognitive aging, benefits of family and social support on health. </p> <p> Information on physical aging have been updated and topics now include information on the <b>economics of health care for women,</b> evidence for how <b>racial discrimination</b> affects health and health care, and what <b>longitudinal studies of Catholic nuns tell us about aging.</b> </p> <p> Research on cognitive aging is updated and includes sections on <b>judgment and decision making,</b> the role of <b>expertise,</b> and how aging affects <b>driving abilities (and voting).</b> It also includes a new theory of <b>long-term working memory</b> in older adults and research on how <b>formal schooling</b> effects cognitive decline. </p> <p> The social roles chapter features role transition theory, and the section on gender roles includes the debate on <b>social role theory versus evolutionary psychology.</b> Other roles that are featured are that of <b>young adults</b> who remain in their parents home (or return after leaving), <b>grandparents</b> raising grandchildren, and <b>caregivers</b> for infirm family members. It also includes material on the transition to the role of <b>care receiver</b> in older adulthood. </p> <p> The relationship chapter includes new information on <b>mate selection</b> and how the criteria has changed over the past 50 years, research on <b>long-term marriages</b> from different racial and cultural groups, new material on <b>late-life divorces</b> and their effect on adult children, the changing role of grandparents, and how <b>parental investment theory</b> explains diversity in grandparent/grandchild relationships. </p> <p> The chapter on work and retirement has been substantially rewritten and includes more information from <b>vocational psychology.</b> Gender differences in work patterns are discussed as well as their implications on <b>women's retirement years.</b> Also included are information on how genetics may affect career choice, the effects of <b>work schedules</b> on marriage, a new section on <b>household work</b> (and who does it), new material on the <b>timing of retirement,</b> and <b>alternatives to retirement.</b> How women approach retirement, lifestyle changes at retirement, and how retirement is done in other countries are also discussed. </p> <p> The chapter on personality has been substantially rewritten and organized, updating the <b>stability versus change</b> question and adding new questions about the <b>universality of personality traits</b> and the roles of <b>genetics, natural selection,</b> and <b>person-environment transactions.</b> Erikson, Jung, and Maslow are covered and new extensions of their theories are discussed (de St. Aubin &amp; McAdams on <b>generativity,</b> Seligman &amp; Csikszentmihalyi on <b>positive psychology,</b> Ryan &amp; Deci on <b>self-determination theory,</b> Ryff on <b>positive psychological functioning</b>). </p> <p> The chapter on stress at different stages of adult life has been substantially rewritten to include new extensions of classic theories (women's <b>tend-and-befriend</b> reaction to stress versus the classic fight-or-flight reaction). A section is added on post traumatic stress disorder among <b>combat veterans. Holocaust survivors</b> (and their adult children); <b>Hurricane Andrew survivors; child victims of crime</b> (and their parents); stress in young adulthood (divorce) middle adulthood (parental bereavement), and older adulthood (widowhood); and the <b>buffering effect of social support</b> (and some negative effects too). </p> <p> Overall, the book has been updated where needed, but classic studies have been retained, often because they have stood the test of time and no new work has been done to call for changes. Several chapters have been substantially rewritten, all the openings are new as are the <b>Critical Thinking Questions</b> and the <b>Suggested Readings.</b> The number of <b>suggested readings</b> has increased and they are arranged in three categories: <b>Classic Studies,</b> which are pioneering work on the chapter topic, <b>Scholarly Articles,&lt;...</b></p></p><h2>Nursing Diagnosis Handbook: An Evidence-Based Guide to Planning Care</h2><p>Use this convenient resource to formulate nursing diagnoses and create individualized care plans!

To meet the varied needs of today's recreational, naval, and commercial navigators the Naval Institute introduces this new edition of a guide that has remained the seafarers' choice for more than three-quarters of a century. It blends the traditional navigation techniques first compiled by Benjamin Dutton in 1926 with technological marvels of the twenty-first century to authoritatively cover all phases of surface navigation. For example, while the book acknowledges that many navigators still peer into the skies through sextant telescopes, it also helps them take full advantage of man-made Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites.<br><p>Valued as both an indispensable quick reference and a comprehensive text, Dutton's makes accessible such foreboding subjects as spherical trigonometry through the use of step-by-step explanations and examples that encourage practical use. To insure accuracy and relevancy, a board of experts made up of naval and Coast Guard officers, merchant mariners, accredited harbor pilots, and sea-service academy professors, has carefully reviewed this fifteenth edition. The result is an unparalleled treatment of the art and science of nautical navigation that both amateur and veteran navigators will use to safely navigate the waters of the world.</p></p><p>Thomas J.

Working from classic texts of European and American writers--including Herman Melville, Henry James, Marcel Proust, and Oscar Wilde--Sedgwick delineates a historical moment in which sexual identity became as important a demarcation of personhood as gender had been for centuries.<p> Sedgwick's literary analysis, while provocative and often startling (you will never read <i>Billy Budd</i> or <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> the same way again), is simply the basis for a larger project of examining and analyzing how the categories of "homosexual" and "heterosexual" continue to shape almost all aspects of contemporary thought. <i>Epistemology of the Closet</i> is a sometimes-dense work, but one filled with wit and empathy. Sedgwick writes with great intelligence and an eye for irony, but always makes clear that her theories and critical acumen are in the service of a politic that seeks to make the world a better and more humane place for everyone. An extraordinary book that reshapes how we think about literature, sexuality, and everyday life. <i>--Michael Bronski</i></p><b>Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick (</b>May 2, 1950 &#x2013; April 12, 2009)&nbsp;was a poet, artist, literary critic and teacher.

Readers will find Stephen E. Ambrose writing on the D-Day landing, James M. McPherson on the battle of Antietam, John Keegan on the changing experience of combat, Jean Bethke Elshtain on Jane Addams, Mark A. Noll on religion and war, and Robert M. Utley on Sitting Bull. Ranging from brief factual pieces to extensive essays, the entries examine every major war from the Revolution to the Persian Gulf; important battles from Bunker Hill, to the Alamo, Gettysburg, Little Bighorn, Normandy, and Khe Sanh; and military leaders from Washington to Grant, Lee, Eisenhower, MacArthur, Westmoreland, and Schwarzkopf. Moreover, the <em>Companion</em> goes well beyond the usual "drum and trumpet" coverage to examine a wide range of subjects you might not expect to find. There are entries on relevant acts of Congress and on diplomatic policies such as the Monroe Doctrine and the Marshall Plan; on peace and antiwar movements; on war in film, literature, music, and photography; and on war viewed through the disciplinary lenses of anthropology, economics, gender studies, and psychology. The result is the widest ranging account compiled in one volume of war, peace, and the U.S. military.<br> With over a thousand authoritative and vividly written entries, maps of several major wars, extensive cross-referencing, lists of further readings, and an index, this volume is the first place to turn for information on our nation's military history.<br></p><p><br><strong>John Whiteclay Chambers II</strong> is Professor of History and former chair of the History Department at Rutgers University.

According to the editor, most references on military history simply recite information on wars, battles, and leaders. This one follows a truly interdisciplinary approach and provides not only the traditional fare of battles but also surveys such disparate topics as politics, economics, culture, gender, institutions, and theories.<p>Among the more than 1,000 alphabetically arranged entries are accounts of several hundred historical battles and events. Other articles cover concepts, such as <i>National security </i>and <i>Just war theory</i>; the armed services (including such entries as <i>Ethnicity and race in the military </i>and <i>Gay men and lesbians in the military)</i>; and histories of weapons and materials. In addition, there are discussions relating to social and economic perspectives, law and ethics, dissent, and popular culture, as well as several hundred biographies. Coverage extends from colonial times to the crisis in Kosovo and Bosnia in 1999. Entries vary from a few hundred words to several thousand words in length. Longer entries, such as <i>Civil War</i>, are frequently broken down into chapters.</p><p>A typical entry will have asterisks in the text denoting cross-references. Many entries also have <i>See also</i> references at the end, as well as bibliographies of current books and an occasional periodical. There are no illustrations. Rounding out the volume are a detailed index and several appendixes. The first appendix consists of five line maps depicting the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, World War II in Europe and the Pacific, and Vietnam. A second appendix contains a table showing casualties in conflicts and major wars and another table showing military ranks.</p><p>There is a plethora of references on military history but nothing comparable to the <i>Oxford Companion to American Military History</i>.

P. Lovecraft</b>&nbsp;was born in 1890 in Providence, Rhode Island, where he lived most of his life. Frequent illnesses in his youth disrupted his schooling, but Lovecraft gained a wide knowledge of many subjects through independent reading and study. He wrote many essays and poems early in his career, but gradually focused on the writing of horror stories, after the advent in 1923 of the pulp magazine&nbsp;<i>Weird Tales</i>, to which he contributed most of his fiction. His relatively small corpus of fiction&#x2014;three short novels and about sixty short stories&#x2014;has nevertheless exercised a wide influence on subsequent work in the field, and he is regarded as the leading twentieth-century American author of supernatural fiction.

Many Americans are doubtful, and have withdrawn into apathy and cynicism. But thousands of others are not ready to give up on democracy just yet. Working outside the notice of the national media, ordinary citizens across the nation are meeting in living rooms, church basements, synagogues, and schools to identify shared concerns, select and cultivate leaders, and take action. Their goal is to hold big government and big business accountable. In this important new book, Jeffrey Stout bears witness to the successes and failures of progressive grassroots organizing, and the daunting forces now arrayed against it.</p><br><p> Stout tells vivid stories of people fighting entrenched economic and political interests around the country. From parents and teachers striving to overcome gang violence in South Central Los Angeles, to a Latino priest north of the Rio Grande who brings his parish into a citizens' organization, to the New Orleans residents who get out the vote by taking a jazz band through streets devastated by Hurricane Katrina, Stout describes how these ordinary people conceive of citizenship, how they acquire and exercise power, and how religious ideas and institutions contribute to their successes.</p><br><p> The most important book on organizing and grassroots democracy in a generation, <i>Blessed Are the Organized</i> is a passionate and hopeful account of how our endangered democratic principles can be put into action.</p></p><p><p>"The subject of civil society ranks among the most important topics of contemporary democracy. Jeffrey Stout treats this subject in a manner that is original, bold, and saturated with concrete detail. This is an important book for all friends of democracy around the world."<b>--Adam Michnik, author of <i>Letters from Prison and Other Essays</i></b></p><p>"Democracy, as Jeffrey Stout shows us, is hard work: a tireless, contestatory struggle to make government responsible and to gain recognition and satisfaction for the civically deprived. Channeling the voices of those engaged in this struggle, Stout forces us to rethink our ideas about citizenship and democracy."<b>--Philip Pettit, coauthor of <i>A Political Philosophy in Public Life</i></b></p><p>"<i>Blessed Are the Organized</i> matches or exceeds its author's previous prize-winning books. I am in awe at how well Jeffrey Stout has transitioned from philosophy of religion to ethnographic research. Would that most ethnographers were able to do field research this well and make it as engaging and powerful."<b>--Robert Wuthnow, Princeton University</b></p><p>"This engaging book makes a significant contribution to the ongoing discussion of the character and future of American democracy. It introduces readers to a long-standing and effective community organizing movement, and offers a hopeful but realistic assessment of what could happen if this model were implemented more widely and consistently. Stout offers a brilliant explanation of the political choices that now lie before us as a nation and as an emerging global society."<b>--Robin W.

Boswell and the Making of A Secret American Empire</h2><p>J.G. Boswell is the biggest farmer in America. Over the past fifty years he has built a secret empire while thumbing his nose at nature, politicians, labor unions and every journalist who ever tried to lift the veil on the ultimate "factory in the fields." Now eighty years old, with an almost pathological bent toward privacy, Boswell has spent the past few years confiding one of the great stories of the American West to Mark Arax and Rick Wartzman. <i>The King of California</i> is the previously untold account of how a Georgia slave-owning family migrated to California in the early 1920s,drained one of America 's biggest lakes in an act of incredible hubris and carved out the richest cotton empire in the world. Indeed, the sophistication of Boswell 's agricultural operation -from lab to field to gin - is unrivaled anywhere.<br><br> Much more than a business story, this is a sweeping social history that details the saga of cotton growers who were chased from the South by the boll weevil and brought their black farmhands to California.

This course started out as a survey course, and then evolved according to our mutual interests and inclinations into a course that emphasizes the signals and systemsaspects-or more precisely, the signal processing aspects-of medical imaging. With signal processing as the fundamental viewpoint, this book covers the most important imaging modalitiesin radiology: projection radiography, x-ray computed tomography, nuclear medicine, ultrasound imaging, and magnetic resonance imaging. The authors expect the reader to be familiar with signals and systems, which are usually covered in the sophomore year of most engineering curricula, and with elementary probability. Freshman courses in physics, chemistry, and calculus are also assumed. The book is organized into parts emphasizing key overall conceptual divisions, as follows. Part I introduces basic imaging principles, including an introduction to medical imaging systems in Chapter 1, a review of signal processing in Chapter 2 with emphasis on two-dimensional signals , and a discussion of image quality in Chapter 3. Our presentation of the theory of medical imaging systems is strongly based on continuous signals; however, a development of discrete signals is included to permit discussions on sampling and implementation. Issues of image quality, including resolution, noise, contrast, geometric distortion, and artifacts are described in general context here, but revisited within each modality in subsequent chapters. Part II describes key modalities in radiographic imaging. It begins in Chapter 4 with a brief presentation of the physics of radiography, including the generation and detection of ionizing radiation and its effect on the human body. Chapter 5 describes projection radiography systems, including chest x-ray and fluoroscopy systems. As in all subsequent chapters, coverage focuses on signals, including only enough physics and biology to motivate the modality and provide a model for the analysis. Chapter 5 also presents the mathematics of projection imaging, a very fundamental idea in medical imaging. Chapters 6 covers x-ray computed tomography, expanding on the instrumentation and mathematics of projection imagingand introducing the concept of image reconstruction in medical imaging. Computed tomography produces true tomograms images of cross sections of the body rather than projections of the body. Part IV presents the physics and modalities of nuclear medicine imaging. Chapter 7 describes the physics of nuclear medicine, focusing primarily on the concept of radioactivity. The major modalities in nuclear medicine imaging are described in Chapter 8, which covers planar scintigraphy, and Chapter 9, which covers emission computed tomography. Part IV covers ultrasound imaging. It begins in Chapter 10 with a brief presentation of the physics of sound, and continues in Chapter 11 with the various imaging modes offered within this rich modality. Part V covers magnetic resonance imaging. Chapter 11 presents the physics of nuclear magnetic resonance, and Chapter 12 continues with a presentation of various magnetic resonance imaging techniques. We have used drafts of this book for a one-semester upper-level/graduate course on medical imaging systems. In order to cover the material in one semester, we routinely skip some material in the book and we move at a very brisk pace. We feel that this book could be used in a two-semester course as well, perhaps by covering Parts I-III in the first semester and Parts IV-V in the second semester. A two-semester approach would allow instructors to use supplementary materials for additional depth or to present current research topics. Medical imaging is very visual-just ask any radiologist. Although the formalism of signals and systems is mathematical, we understand the advantages offered through visualization. Therefore, the book contains many images and diagrams. Some are strictly pedagogical, offered in conjunction with the exposition or an example problem. Others are motivational, &#39;revealing interesting features for discussion or study. Special emphasis is made to provide biologically relevant examples including images, so that the important context of medical imaging can be appreciated by students. Many students, friends, colleagues, and teaching assistants contributed to this book through discussions and critiques. Xiao Han, Li Pan, and Vijay Parthasarathy contributed problems and solutions, and Aaron Carass fixed many LaTeX and CVS problems. A special note of appreciation is due to Xiaodong Tao, who created and solved many of the examples and problems. We would also like to thank Rama Chellappa, Brian Caffo, and Sarah Ying, who provided comments and suggestions on several parts of the book. We also thank William R. Brody, who inspired the creation of the course out of which this book grew and who also wrote one of the chapters in our original course notes. Finally, we convey special thanks to Elliot R. McVeigh and John I. Goutsias, who co-taught our course at Hopkins during the early years and helped draft the original version of this book. JERRY L. PRINCEJONATHAN M.

This popular dictionary's 300,000 words, senses and definitions combine in one reference book information on English as it is used worldwide and as it is used particularly in Canada. Definitions, worded for ease of comprehension, are presented so that the meaning most familiar to Canadians appears first and foremost. Each of these entries is exceptionally reliable, the result of thorough research into the language and Oxford's unparalleled language resources.

More than 200 new Canadian terms have also been identified and added; altogether, the dictionary defines 2,200 Canadian words and senses.<p>As with the previous edition, definitions are arranged so that the meaning most familiar to Canadians comes first. New to this edition are preferred word breaks and parts of speech that are written in full instead of being abbreviated. Part of the fun in a guide to Canadian English is checking the differences between standard American and Canadian pronunciations and spellings: <i>schedule</i> is pronounced <i>skedule</i> and red is a <i>color</i> on the American side of the border, but <i>schedule</i> and <i>colour</i> prevail on the Canadian side. <i>Chesterfield, gold eye, jam buster</i>, and other Canadian expressions and words will be found here, as will new words and terms known more widely, such as <i>supersize</i> and <i>weapon of mass destruction</i>. The COD also includes short entries for proper nouns and names of more than 1,400 Canadian places and 850 Canadian people as well as people and geographical locations from around the world. Like the first edition, the second concludes with several appendixes: a six-page style guide, a list of the prime ministers and governors general of Canada, weights and measures (Canada measures using the metric system), a short history of the English language, and the Arabic, Hebrew, Greek, and Russian alphabets.</p><p>The COD is a must for any U.S. library close to the Canadian border and for academic institutions with Canadian studies programs (or <i>programmes</i>).

Rachel Carson's book focused on the poisons from insecticides, weed killers, and other common products as well as the use of sprays in agriculture, a practice that led to dangerous chemicals to the food source. Carson argued that those chemicals were more dangerous than radiation and that for the first time in history, humans were exposed to chemicals that stayed in their systems from birth to death. Presented with thorough documentation, the book opened more than a few eyes about the dangers of the modern world and stands today as a landmark work.Rachel Carson (1907&#x2013;1964) spent most of her professional life as a marine biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. By the late 1950s, she had written three lyrical, popular books about the sea, including the best-selling The Sea Around Us, and had become the most respected science writer in America. She completed Silent Spring against formidable personal odds, and with it shaped a powerful social movement that has altered the course of history.</p><h2>Dictionary of Untranslatables: A Philosophical Lexicon (Translation/Transnation, 35)</h2><p><p><b>A one-of-a-kind reference to the international vocabulary of the humanities</b></p><p>This is an encyclopedic dictionary of close to 400 important philosophical, literary, and political terms and concepts that defy easy&#x2015;or any&#x2015;translation from one language and culture to another.

In the newly updated and expanded edition of Communication Skills in Children with Down Syndrome, Libby Kumin offers comprehensive, authoritative, and practical advice based on her nearly 25 years of firsthand experience with kids with Down syndrome. She explains the role of a SLP, the stages of communication development, and how certain characteristics of Down syndrome, such as low muscle tone, hearing loss, and cognitive delays, can slow progression of those skills. Delays can lead to frustration and other problems for children who do not have intelligible speech until age 2 or later. <p>EARLY COMMUNICATION SKILLS FOR CHILDREN WITH DOWN SYNDROME focuses on speech and language development from birth through the stage of making 3-word phrases, which is often around kindergarten age, but can occur later. This book offers a wealth of information on intelligibility issues, hearing loss, apraxia (difficulty planning oral-motor movements), and other factors that affect communication for children with Down syndrome. It explains how to prepare for and understand the results of speech-language assessment, and goes on to describe what to expect in the years ahead when a child enters elementary school. </p><p>Throughout the new edition, the author incorporates the latest research on Down syndrome and communication development. She has added new chapters on high- and low-tech augmentative and alternative communication options, as well as articulation and literacy (how reading aids in the learning of language, speech, and auditory skills). New checklists on evaluating and treating speech problems, and numerous home activities designed to help children master each stage of communication development have also been added.</p></p><p>Libby Kumin, Ph.D., CCC-SLP, is the Director of the Graduate Program of the Department of Speech-Language Pathology/Audiology at Loyola College in Baltimore, Maryland, where she founded the Down Syndrome Center for Excellence.

Welcome to a world of Father Christmases behaving oddly, a famous fictional detective in a Yuletide drama, mysterious tracks in the snow, and some very unpleasant carol singers. There's no denying that the supposed season of goodwill is a time of year that lends itself to detective fiction.</strong></p><p>On a cold night, it's tempting to curl up by the fireside with a good mystery. And more than that, claustrophobic house parties, with people cooped up with long-estranged relatives, can provide plenty of motives for murder.</p><p>Including forgotten stories by major writers such as Margery Allingham, as well as classic tales by less familiar crime novelists, each story in this selection is introduced by the leading expert on classic crime, Martin Edwards. The resulting volume is an entertaining and atmospheric compendium of wintry delights.</p></p><p><p><strong>MARTIN EDWARDS</strong> is an award-winning crime writer best known for two series of novels set in Liverpool and the Lake District. He is a series consultant for British Library Crime Classics, Chair of the Crime Writers' Association, and President of the Detection Club. <em>The Golden Age of Murder</em>, his study of the Detection Club, was published in 2015 to international acclaim, and won the Edgar, Agatha, H.R.F.

(Kristy H <i><b>NetGalley</b></i>)<br><br>"I love a vintage murder mystery story and this book is full of them, all with a Christmas theme. It would make a brilliant gift for anyone who enjoys this genre. The stories are all good classics of their time, which keep you guessing right to the very end. Nothing too gory just good old detective work. Also worthy of note, are the introductions which tell you about the authors and their literary careers, all very interesting and inspiring. Grab a glass of something, sit down in front of a roaring fire and enjoy!" (Katrina Oliver <i><b>NetGalley</b></i>)<br><br>"In this imaginative anthology, Edwards president of Britain's Detection Club has gathered together overlooked criminous gems by such old pros as Edgar Wallace, Margery Allingham, Julian Symons and Michael Gilbert, to name only the most famous.

The stories are vintage crime and are like a trip memory lane....Well crafted, good storylines and a real pleasure to read." (Leyla Johnson <i><b>NetGalley</b></i>)<br><br>"<i>Crimson Snow</i> is a collection of short stories in the British Library Crime Classics series. The stories were written between 1906 and 1992 which goes to show that a good, seasonal crime story is a pretty timeless thing and, although most are pure detective stories, some have an air of ghost stories giving an eeirie cast to the book."

With a richness of detail and sweeping breadth of historical examples, he chronicles and analyzes the history of the opposite ideological extremes of Fascism and Marxism and their descent into totalitarianism via secular religiosity. Aron also examines French imperialism through the examples of Algeria and Indochina, as well as America&#39;s role as an &#34;imperial republic&#34; during and after World War II.Aron was never orthodox in his ideology; neither his republican political penchants nor his dialectical intellectual orientation ever gained the upper hand over his devotion to empirical reality. The result here is an intellectual history that seems less concerned about where it falls on the political spectrum than about getting it right.</p><p>Raymond Aron (1905-1983) was one of the most important figures in sociological and political commentary in the twentieth century. A member of the French Air Force during World War II, he later became an influential columnist of <i>Le Figaro</i>, a position he held for thirty years. He was the author of several books, including <i>The Opium of the Intellectuals</i>, <i>Clausewitz: Philosopher of War</i>, and <i>Main Currents in Sociological Thought</i>.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>First Impressions: A Reader&#x2019;s Journey to Iconic Places of the American Southwest (The Lamar Series in Western History)</h2><p><b>A guide to the history and culture of the American Southwest, as told through early encounters with fifteen iconic sites</b><br><br> This unique guide for literate travelers in the American Southwest tells the story of fifteen iconic sites across Arizona, New Mexico, southern Utah, and southern Colorado through the eyes of the explorers, missionaries, and travelers who were the first non-natives to describe them.

Late one night the body of Mary Gregor, sister of the laird of Duchlan, is found in the castle. She has been stabbed to death in her bedroom&#x2015;but the room is locked from within and the windows are barred. The only tiny clue to the culprit is a silver fish's scale, left on the floor next to Mary's body.</p><p>Inspector Dundas is dispatched to Duchlan to investigate the case. The Gregor family and their servants are quick&#x2015;perhaps too quick&#x2015;to explain that Mary was a kind and charitable woman. Dundas uncovers a more complex truth, and the cruel character of the dead woman continues to pervade the house after her death. Soon further deaths, equally impossible, occur, and the atmosphere grows ever darker. Superstitious locals believe that fish creatures from the nearby waters are responsible; but luckily for Inspector Dundas, the gifted amateur sleuth Eustace Hailey is on the scene, and unravels a more logical solution to this most fiendish of plots.</p><p>Anthony Wynne wrote some of the best locked-room mysteries from the golden age of British crime fiction. This cunningly plotted novel&#x2015;one of Wynne's finest&#x2015;has never been reprinted since 1931, and is long overdue for rediscovery.</p></p><p><p><strong>ANTHONY WYNNE</strong> is a pseudonym of Robert McNair-Wilson (1882-1963), who wrote twenty-seven detective novels featuring Eustace Hailey, a physician and amateur sleuth. He also published on economics and history, notably a biography of Napoleon.</p><p><i>Murder of a Lady</i> is a mystery novel set in Scotland and originally published in 1931. It's the amateur sleuth, Hailey, that's the main character and who solved the case. It's a "locked room" mystery that could potentially be solved in several ways. There were clues, and you could guess whodunit from the clues, but some critical clues weren't discovered until nearly the end....I originally guessed something similar to what the second inspector concluded, and my solution still seems more plausible to me than the actual solution. Having worked with the murder weapon before, I think whodunit was extremely lucky that everything happened exactly right to get the desired end and that no one noticed that certain things went missing at the time of the crime....The characters were more "types" of people or pieces of a puzzle than people to sympathize with or hate. There was no sex or bad language. Overall, I still enjoyed reading the story and would recommend this mystery.</p> (<i><b><i>Genre Reviews</i></b></i>)<br><br><p>This was a fairly dark mystery with a good setting. I found it much more an old fashioned "puzzle" but it was an enjoyable read.</p> (<i><b>Goodreads</b></i>)<br><br><p>I wasn't familiar with this author, but I love to read British mysteries of this time period and the locked-room scenario is a favorite. The ending was not expected.</p> (<i><b>NetGalley</b></i>)<br><br><p>The major focus in <i>Murder of a Lady</i> is the puzzle: The characters are only developed so far as they serve the plot. And what a plot it is, full of impossibilities, troubles from the past, tormented lovers, and a slew of mixed motives. There is not just one impossible murder: The following murders seem equally impossible. In the course of the characters' investigations, Wynne brings up several plausible solutions before the matter is fully cleared up....<i>Murder of a Lady</i> is another entry into Poisoned Pen Press's publication of The British Library Crime Classic collection. Out of print since 1931, the novel is perfect for readers who love Agatha Christie but who have made their way through all her works - or who just want a change of pace while keeping to the classic, sleek, constructions of the era...</p> (<i><b>NetGalley</b></i>)<br><br><p>First published in 1931, this reissue in the British Library crime classics series brings back what some consider a more innocent era, when psychology seemed simpler and no one ever used terms like sociopath or psychopath. In his heyday, Wynne (1882-1963) was considered to be the master of locked-room mysteries, and he acquits himself well in this Dr. Eustace Hailey mystery. Hailey travels to a castle in the Scottish Highlands to investigate the demise of Miss Mary Gregor, sister to the laird. She has been found stabbed to death in her locked bedroom. Miss Gregor at first is described as pious and good. But it soon becomes clear that pious can be interpreted as sanctimonious and goodness can serve as a shield for nastier intentions. Others follow her to the grave in equally inexplicable circumstances. Those who like black-and-white films, in which ladies and gentlemen dress for dinner and everyone has frightfully good manners, are in for a treat.</p> (<i><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b></i>)<br><br><p>A true locked room mystery from the Golden Age of Mystery writing, <i>Murder of a Lady</i> was chock full of twists and turns. The writing was of that era, and as such, more formal than our modern ear is attuned to, with many words and phrases which required thought. Not only was the murder mystery itself wickedly lovely, but the author's descriptions placed me right there in Scotland in 1931....Lies, half-truths, unspoken tragedy, paychosis, jealousy, piety, gambling debts, forbidden love....it is all here in the many twists, turns, plots and subplots that make <i>Murder of a Lady</i> a Golden Age Classic that truly withstands the test of time!</p> (<i><b>NetGalley</b></i>)<br><br><p>Although the focus is largely on the locked-room puzzle of how the crime could have been done, there's some pretty good characterisation along the way. I particularly liked the way Wynne portrayed the women, showing them as subordinate within this society, but strong within themselves; victims sometimes, but not hysterical ones; and intelligent, worthy partners for the men they loved....Of course, there is more than one murder, and I have to admit that the second one took me totally by surprise and actually made me gasp a little. There's no real horror aspect in the book, but it nevertheless builds a great atmosphere of rather creepy tension, aided by the superstitions of the Highland folk....I enjoyed this one very much another author the British Library has managed to add to my list!</p> (Leah Galbraith <i><b>NetGalley</b></i>)<br><br><p>This is an intriguing story with a great many undercurrents and tensions between the occupants of the castle, most of whom seem to have been scared of the murdered woman. The plot is perhaps a shade melodramatic for today's readers but the plot and the characters are very well done and the psychological motivations are realistic....There is an atmosphere almost of menace which permeates the whole book and I found myself tempted to keep looking over my shoulder in fear as I read.</p> (<i><b><i>Jillysheep</i></b></i>)<br><br><p>This 1931 novel, now republished as part of the British Library's Crime Classics series, is a cunningly concocted locked-room mystery, a staple of Golden Age detective fiction. Actually, it's a series of locked-room mysteries, all occurring within the gloomy, twisted corridors of Duchlan Castle in the Scottish Highlands. The laird and lady of the stately but dilapidated home are an elderly brother and sister who seem to make an effort to make their house uncomfortable and dreary. Wynne&#x2019;s depiction of the home and the way it mirrors the psychology of its inhabitants is worthy of Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. The novel shifts from mood to murder when the sister, Mary Gregor, is found dead in her room, with a knife wound near her throat. The room had been locked from the inside and the windows shut. A fish scale is found on the wound. This evidence is observed by Wynne's recurring hero, the physician and amateur sleuth Dr. Eustace Hailey, who has been called to the scene. From this point on, murder follows murder, all of them "impossible crimes." The way that Hailey uses his long experience, especially with observing human nature, is absolutely fascinating. Seeing what happens in real time from Hailey's point of view adds to the delight in watching him solve these puzzles. As Dorothy L. Sayers wrote (as quoted in the introduction to this volume): "Mr. Anthony Wynne excels in the solution of apparently insoluble problems." A great return of a great detective. <b>(starred review)</b></p> (<i><b><i>Booklist</i></b></i>)<br><br><p>A talented amateur sleuth takes on a locked-room murder in this golden age whodunit....This classic British mystery, first published in 1931, has enough complex plotting and red herrings to win a new generation of fans for the largely forgotten Wynne.</p> (<i><b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b></i>)</p><h2>An Introduction To Brain and Behavior.

The heat index, which measures how the temperature actually feels on the body, would hit 126 degrees by the time the day was over. Meteorologists had been warning residents about a two-day heat wave, but these temperatures did not end that soon. When the heat wave broke a week later, city streets had buckled; the records for electrical use were shattered; and power grids had failed, leaving residents without electricity for up to two days. And by July 20, over seven hundred people had perished-more than twice the number that died in the Chicago Fire of 1871, twenty times the number of those struck by Hurricane Andrew in 1992&#x2014;in the great Chicago heat wave, one of the deadliest in American history.<br><br>Heat waves in the United States kill more people during a typical year than all other natural disasters combined. Until now, no one could explain either the overwhelming number or the heartbreaking manner of the deaths resulting from the 1995 Chicago heat wave. Meteorologists and medical scientists have been unable to account for the scale of the trauma, and political officials have puzzled over the sources of the city's vulnerability. In <i>Heat Wave</i>, Eric Klinenberg takes us inside the anatomy of the metropolis to conduct what he calls a "social autopsy," examining the social, political, and institutional organs of the city that made this urban disaster so much worse than it ought to have been.<br><br>Starting with the question of why so many people died at home alone, Klinenberg investigates why some neighborhoods experienced greater mortality than others, how the city government responded to the crisis, and how journalists, scientists, and public officials reported on and explained these events. Through a combination of years of fieldwork, extensive interviews, and archival research, Klinenberg uncovers how a number of surprising and unsettling forms of social breakdown&#x2014;including the literal and social isolation of seniors, the institutional abandonment of poor neighborhoods, and the retrenchment of public assistance programs&#x2014;contributed to the high fatality rates. The human catastrophe, he argues, cannot simply be blamed on the failures of any particular individuals or organizations. For when hundreds of people die behind locked doors and sealed windows, out of contact with friends, family, community groups, and public agencies, everyone is implicated in their demise.<br><br>As Klinenberg demonstrates in this incisive and gripping account of the contemporary urban condition, the widening cracks in the social foundations of American cities that the 1995 Chicago heat wave made visible have by no means subsided as the temperatures returned to normal. The forces that affected Chicago so disastrously remain in play in America's cities, and we ignore them at our peril.</p><p><b>Eric Klinenberg</b> is a professor of sociology at New York University and editor of the journal <i>Public Culture</i>. He is also the author of <i>Fighting for Air: The Battle to Control America's Media</i> and the coeditor of <i>The Making and Unmaking of Whiteness</i>.Like motorists who slow down to stare at the aftermath of car crashes, most people are fascinated by meteorologic disasters. The perils of weathering a hurricane, a tsunami's destruction of property, and the human drama of a flood all make for riveting tales of struggle and survival. Yet one kind of weather-related catastrophe -- a deadly wave of heat and humidity -- seems not to get nearly the notice given the others, despite the fact that it kills more than all the other kinds combined. Why heat waves are such a quiet menace and how social conditions contributed to more than 700 deaths during a week-long wave of unprecedented heat and humidity in Chicago in 1995 are the focus of Heat Wave: A Social Autopsy of Disaster in Chicago, written by sociologist Eric Klinenberg. The term "social isolation" is usually applied to those living in remote locations, but Klinenberg demonstrates that this unfortunate condition also applies to thousands of people (primarily senior citizens) in our nation's largest cities. And so it was in 1995. Thousands of Chicago's elderly lived alone (many of them in or near poverty), isolated in many ways and by many factors. When the record-breaking heat and humidity arrived and stayed, these men and women started dying, one at a time and quietly, behind closed, locked doors. The immediate reasons were apparent. Many seniors did not have air conditioning in their houses or apartments. Of those who did have air conditioning, many chose not to use it, fearing utility bills that they could not afford to pay. Fear of crime kept others from leaving their homes to use free neighborhood "cooling centers." Still other elderly Chicagoans knew, from a physiological standpoint, that they were hot but were simply unaware that they were in danger. Klinenberg shows in detail how the tragedy was compounded by many factors and interests, including a public health and medical establishment that did not anticipate the magnitude of the looming danger and local news media that treated the severe heat and humidity as little more than a novel topic for lighthearted feature stories. The author also examines key sociological factors relating to the elderly, including the perils of "aging in place" while the surrounding environment changes; the idealization and valuing of personal independence among seniors; and differences between men and women in the establishment of friendships and other interpersonal connections. Heat Wave is a fascinating book, in part because the social conditions that led to Chicago's 1995 tragedy still exist, for the most part, throughout our nation and its aging population. People are still at risk. The book is not without its flaws. Klinenberg strays from sociological analysis and into a politicized attack when he examines the 1995 response of Mayor Richard M. Daley and his administration. He makes far too much of the mayor's brief questioning of exactly what constitutes a "heat-related death" -- a question, I might add, that most of us had at the time. The author erroneously claims that the response of the Daley administration was driven more by public-relations damage control than by a desire to understand the tragedy and prevent further deaths and that a report issued by the Mayor's Commission on Extreme Weather Conditions was little more than "spin," when it was in fact the product of careful deliberation by leading figures in public health, medicine, gerontology, meteorology, and other fields. Indeed, the report laid the groundwork for Chicago's successful response to extreme weather, which was credited with saving hundreds of lives in the summer of 1999. The report has been widely requested by and circulated to public health planners throughout the nation. Other descriptions of the mayoral response are similarly off-base. As a deputy commissioner of the Health Department in 1995, I was there for every step of the action, in front of the cameras and microphones and around the table at meetings about emergency response. Klinenberg and his sources were not there. Klinenberg also puts considerable emphasis on racial disparities in the 1995 heat deaths. (The raw death totals indicate a rough parity between mortality rates in the black and white populations, but age-adjusted rates supplied by the author claim otherwise.) In his biography posted on the Web site of Northwestern University, where he teaches, Klinenberg notes his interest in the exploration of "race as a principle of vision, division, and domination." His focus on race is therefore understandable, but many do not see race as the risk factor that he claims it is. Its flaws aside, Heat Wave is a thought-provoking examination that challenges everyone in medicine and public health to look beyond our training to consider sociological conditions as risk factors. It issues a call for all segments of the population to reestablish those familial and social connections that we once seemed to have but now, all too often, do not. <i>John Wilhelm, M.D., M.P.H.</i><br>Copyright � 2002 Massachusetts Medical Society.

The western sky was a sulphurous yellow and the sun a red ball dropping slowly behind the trees and house-tops. Its setting left the rest of the heavens grey with clouds.<br><br> "Huh! A storm's coming'," said Aunt Hager aloud.<br><br> A pullet ran across the back yard and into a square-cut hole in an unpainted piano-box which served as the roosting-house. An old hen clucked her brood together and, with the tiny chicks, went into a small box beside the large one. The air was very still. Not a leaf stirred on the green apple-tree. Not a single closed flower of the morning-glories trembled on the back fence. The air was very still and yellow. Something sultry and oppressive made a small boy in the doorway stand closer to his grandmother, clutching her apron with his brown hands.<br><br> "Sho is a storm comin'," said Aunt Hager.<br><br> "I hope mama gets home 'fore it rains," remarked the brown child holding to the old woman's apron. "Hope she gets home."<br><br> "I does, too," said Aunt Hager. "But I's skeared she won't."<br><br> Just then great drops of water began to fall heavily into the back yard, pounding up little clouds of dust where each drop struck the earth. For a few moments they pattered violently on the roof like a series of hammer-strokes; then suddenly they ceased.<br><br> "Come in, chile," said Aunt Hager.<br><br> She closed the door as the green apple-tree began to sway in the wind and a small hard apple fell, rolling rapidly down the top of the piano-box that sheltered the chickens. Inside the kitchen it was almost dark. While Aunt Hager lighted an oil-lamp, the child climbed to a chair and peered through the square window into the yard. The leaves and flowers of the morning-glory vines on the back fence were bending with the rising wind. And across the alley at the big house, Mrs. Kennedy's rear screen-door banged to and fro, and Sandy saw her garbage-pail suddenly tip over and roll down into the yard, scattering potato-peelings on the white steps.<br><br> "Sho gwine be a terrible storm," said Hager as she turned up the wick of the light and put the chimney on. Then, glancing through the window, she saw a black cloud twisting like a ribbon in the western sky, and the old woman screamed aloud in sudden terror: "It's a cyclone! It's gwine be a cyclone! Sandy, let's get over to Mis' Carter's quick, 'cause we ain't got no cellar here. Come on, chile, let's get! Come on, chile! . . . Come on, chile!"<br><br> Hurriedly she blew out the light, grabbed the boy's hand; and together they rushed through the little house towards the front. It was quite dark in the inner rooms, but through the parlor windows came a sort of sooty grey-green light that was rapidly turning to blackness.<br><br> "Lawd help us, Jesus!"<br><br> Aunt Hager opened the front door, but before she or the child could move, a great roaring sound suddenly shook the world, and, with a deafening division of wood from wood, they saw their front porch rise into the air and go hurtling off into space. Sailing high in the gathering darkness, the porch was soon lost to sight. And the black wind blew with terrific force, numbing the ear-drums.<br><br> For a moment the little house trembled and swayed and creaked as though it were about to fall.<br><br> "Help me to shut this do'," Aunt Hager screamed; "help me to shut it, Lawd!" as with all her might she struggled against the open door, which the wind held back, but finally it closed and the lock caught. Then she sank to the floor with her back against the wall, while her small grandson trembled like a leaf as she took him in her lap, mumbling: "What a storm! . . . O, Lawdy! . . . O, ma chile, what a storm!"<br><br> They could hear the crackling of timbers and the rolling limbs of trees that the wind swept across the roof. Her arms tightened about the boy.<br><br> "Dear Jesus!" she said. "I wonder where is yo' mama? S'pose she started out fo' home 'fore this storm come up!" Then in a scream: "Have mercy on ma Annjee! O, Lawd, have mercy on this chile's mama! Have mercy on all ma chillens! Ma Harriett, an' ma Tempy, an' ma Annjee, what's maybe all of 'em out in de storm! O, Lawd!"<br><br> A dry crack of lightning split the darkness, and the boy began to wail. Then the rain broke. The old woman could not see the crying child she held, nor could the boy hear the broken voice of his grandmother, who had begun to pray as the rain crashed through the inky blackness. For a long while it roared on the roof of the house and pounded at the windows, until finally the two within became silent, hushing their cries. Then only the lashing noise of the water, coupled with the feeling that something terrible was happening, or had already happened, filled the evening air.<br> After the rain the moon rose clear and bright and the clouds disappeared from the lately troubled sky. The stars sparkled calmly above the havoc of the storm, and it was still early evening as people emerged from their houses and began to investigate the damage brought by the twisting cyclone that had come with the sunset. Through the rubbish-filled streets men drove slowly with horse and buggy or automobile. The fire-engine was out, banging away, and the soft tang-tang-tang of the motor ambulance could be heard in the distance carrying off the injured.<br><br> Black Aunt Hager and her brown grandson put their rubbers on and stood in the water-soaked front yard looking at the porchless house where they lived. Platform, steps, pillars, roof, and all had been blown away. Not a semblance of a porch was left and the front door opened bare into the yard. It was grotesque and funny. Hager laughed.<br><br> "Cyclone sho did a good job," she said. "Looks like I ain't never had no porch."<br><br> Madam de Carter, from next door, came across the grass, her large mouth full of chattering sympathy for her neighbor.<br><br> "But praise God for sparing our lives! It might've been worse, Sister Williams! It might've been much more calamitouser! As it is, I lost nothin' more'n a chimney and two wash-tubs which was settin' in the back yard. A few trees broke down don't 'mount to nothin'. We's livin', ain't we? And we's more importanter than trees is any day!" Her gold teeth sparkled in the moonlight.<br><br> "'Deed so," agreed Hager emphatically. "Let's move on down de block, Sister, an' see what mo' de Lawd has 'stroyed or spared this evenin'. He's gin us plenty moonlight after de storm so we po' humans can see this lesson o' His'n to a sinful world."<br><br> The two elderly colored women picked their way about on the wet walk, littered with twigs and branches of broken foliage. The little brown boy followed, with his eyes wide at the sight of baby-carriages, window-sashes, shingles, and tree-limbs scattered about in the roadway. Large numbers of people were out, some standing on porches, some carrying lanterns, picking up useful articles from the streets, some wringing their hands in a daze.<br><br> Near the corner a small crowd had gathered quietly.<br><br> "Mis' Gavitt's killed," somebody said.<br><br> "Lawd help!" burst from Aunt Hager and Madam de Carter simultaneously.<br><br> "Mister and Mis' Gavitt's both dead," added a nervous young white man, bursting with the news. "We live next door to 'em, and their house turned clean over! Came near hitting us and breaking our side-wall in."<br><br> "Have mercy!" said the two women, but Sandy slipped away from his grandmother and pushed through the crowd. He ran round the corner to where he could see the overturned house of the unfortunate Gavitts.<br><br> Good white folks, the Gavitts, Aunt Hager had often said, and now their large frame dwelling lay on its side like a doll's mansion, with broken furniture strewn carelessly on the wet lawn&#x2014;and they were dead. Sandy saw a piano flat on its back in the grass. Its ivory keys gleamed in the moonlight like grinning teeth, and the strange sight made his little body shiver, so he hurried back through the crowd looking for his grandmother. As he passed the corner, he heard a woman sobbing hysterically within the wide house there.<br><br> His grandmother was no longer standing where he had left her, but he found Madam de Carter and took hold of her hand. She was in the midst of a group of excited white and colored women. One frail old lady was saying in a high determined voice that she had never seen a cyclone like this in her whole life, and she had lived here in Kansas, if you please, going on seventy-three years. Madam de Carter, chattering nervously, began to tell them how she had recognized its coming and had rushed to the cellar the minute she saw the sky turn green. She had not come up until the rain stopped, so frightened had she been. She was extravagantly enjoying the telling of her fears as Sandy kept tugging at her hand.<br><br> "Where's my grandma?" he demanded. Madam de Carter, however, did not cease talking to answer his question.<br><br> "What do you want, sonny?" finally one of the white women asked, bending down when he looked as if he were about to cry. "Aunt Hager? . . . Why, she's inside helping them calm poor Mrs. Gavitt's niece. Your grandmother's good to have around when folks are sick or grieving, you know. Run and set on the steps like a nice boy and wait until she comes out." So Sandy left the women and went to sit in the dark on the steps of the big corner house where the niece of the dead Mrs. Gavitt lived. There were some people on the porch, but they soon passed through the screen-door into the house or went away down the street. The moonlight cast weird shadows across the damp steps where Sandy sat, and it was dark there under the trees in spite of the moon, for the old house was built far back from the street in a yard full of oaks and maples, and Sandy could see the light from an upstairs window reflecting on the wet leaves of their nearest boughs. He heard a girl screaming, too, up there where the light was burning, and he knew that Aunt Hager was putting cold cloths on her head, or rubbing her hands, or driving folks out of the room, and talking kind to her so that she would soon be better.<br><br> All the neighborhood, white or colored, called his grandmother when something happened. She was a good nurse, they said, and sick folks liked her around. Aunt Hager always came when they called, too, bringing maybe a little soup that she had made or a jelly. Sometimes they paid her and sometimes they didn't. But Sandy had never had to sit outdoors in the darkness waiting for her before. He leaned his small back against the top step and rested his elbows on the porch behind him. It was growing late and the people in the streets had all disappeared.<br><br> There, in the dark, the little fellow began to think about his mother, who worked on the other side of town for a rich white lady named Mrs. J. J. Rice. And suddenly frightful thoughts came into his mind. Suppose she had left for home just as the storm came up! Almost always his mother was home before dark&#x2014;but she wasn't there tonight when the storm came&#x2014;and she should have been home! This thought appalled him. She should have been there! But maybe she had been caught by the storm and blown away as she walked down Main Street! Maybe Annjee had been carried off by the great black wind that had overturned the Gavitts' house and taken his grandma's porch flying through the air! Maybe the cyclone had gotten his mother, Sandy thought. He wanted her! Where was she? Had something terrible happened to her? Where was she now?<br><br> The big tears began to roll down his cheeks&#x2014;but the little fellow held back the sobs that wanted to come. He decided he wasn't going to cry and make a racket there by himself on the strange steps of these white folks' house. He wasn't going to cry like a big baby in the dark. So he wiped his eyes, kicked his heels against the cement walk, lay down on the top step, and, by and by, sniffled himself to sleep.</p><h2>A Cruising Guide to Puget Sound and the San Juan Islands: Olympia to Port Angeles</h2><p><p><b>"Simply put, every local boater should have a dog-eared, well-thumbed copy [of this guide] as a permanent feature in the nautical library."&#x2015;<i>48� North</i></b> </p><p><i>A Cruising Guide to Puget Sound and the San Juan Islands</i> has earned an outstanding reputation for the accuracy of its piloting instructions, the clarity of its writing, and the high quality of its information.

Her new life is full of hope but eighteen years later she is still not free. Sethe&#39;s new home is not only haunted by the memories of her past but also by the ghost of her baby, who died nameless and whose tombstone is engraved with a single word: Beloved.</p><p>As with the ghost at its center, <i>Beloved</i> has taken many forms--from the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel to Oprah Winfrey's decade-in-the-making movie to this challenging audiobook read by Lynn Whitfield. Whitfield, who won an Emmy Award playing the title role in <i>The Josephine Baker Story</i>, has a tough assignment as she guides us back and forth in time with Sethe, an escaped slave who's still shackled by memories of her murdered child. But, as we shift between Sethe's brutal plantation days and her haunted life immediately after the Civil War, we learn one secret after another until, finally, past and present are masterfully reconciled. (Running time: three hours, two cassettes) <i>--Kimberly Heinrichs</i>Toni Morrison--author of Song of Solomon and Tar Baby--is a writer of remarkable powers: her novels, brilliantly acclaimed for their passion, their dazzling language and their lyric and emotional force, combine the unassailable truths of experience and emotion with the vision of legend and imagination. <br>It is the story--set in post-Civil War Ohio--of Sethe, an escaped slave who has risked death in order to wrench herself from a living death; who has lost a husband and buried a child; who has borne the unthinkable and not gone mad: a woman of "iron eyes and backbone to match." Sethe lives in a small house on the edge of town with her daughter, Denver, her mother-in-law, Baby Suggs, and a disturbing, mesmerizing intruder who calls herself Beloved. <br>Sethe works at "beating back the past," but it is alive in all of them. It keeps Denver fearful of straying from the house. It fuels the sadness that has settled into Baby Suggs' "desolated center where the self that was no self made its home." And to Sethe, the past makes itself heard and felt incessantly: in memories that both haunt and soothe her...in the arrival of Paul D ("There was something blessed in his manner. Women saw him and wanted to weep"), one of her fellow slaves on the farm where she had once been kept...in the vivid and painfully cathartic stories she and Paul D tell each other of their years in captivity, of their glimpses of freedom...and, most powerfully, in the apparition of Beloved, whose eyes are expressionless at their deepest point, whose doomed childhood belongs to the hideous logic of slavery and who, as daughter, sister and seductress, has now come from the "place over there" to claim retribution for what shelost and for what was taken from her. <br>Sethe's struggle to keep Beloved from gaining full possession of her present--and to throw off the long, dark legacy of her past--is at the center of this profoundly affecting and startling novel. But its intensity and resonance of feeling, and the boldness of its narrative, lift it beyond its particulars so that it speaks to our experience as an entire nation with a past of both abominable and ennobling circumstance. <br>In Beloved, Toni Morrison has given us a great American novel. <br>Toni Morrison was awarded the 1988 Pulitzer Prize in Literature for Beloved.</p><h2>From Great Paragraphs to Great Essays (Great Writing, New Edition)</h2><p><strong>NOTE: This book will not include an online code.<br></strong><br>Now with engaging National Geographic images, the new edition of the Great Writing series helps students write better sentences, paragraphs, and essays.

A recently discovered treasure, Love, Lucy is the valentine Lucille Ball left for her fans--a warm, wise, and witty memoir written by Lucy herself over 30 years ago. Here is the laughter. Here is the life. Here is Lucille Ball. Foreword by Lucie Arnaz.</p><p>Although Lucille Ball died in 1989, this autobiography written prior to 1964 has only recently been discovered among her papers. She describes a childhood deeply affected by her father&#39;s death and her mother&#39;s withdrawal from her life. Raised by her grandparents, Ball craved attention and developed a tempestuous, vivacious, fiery, and yet insecure personality that would later lead her to comic stardom. It took years of working from the bottom of show business before she became a television hit, with the help of her husband, co-star, and business partner, former Cuban bandleader Desi Arnaz. Ball abandoned the book for fear of hurting Arnaz, although she gives him credit for the tremendous success she enjoyed with &#34;I Love Lucy.&#34;<b>Lucille Ball </b>(1911&#x2013;1989) was a beloved actress, comedienne, and Hollywood icon.

The cause was a complete mystery&#x2014;apparently as much to the technicians replacing the centrifuges as to the inspectors observing them. <br> &nbsp;<br> Then, five months later, a seemingly unrelated event occurred: A computer security firm in Belarus was called in to troubleshoot some computers in Iran that were crashing and rebooting repeatedly.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;At first, the firm&#x2019;s programmers believed the malicious code on the machines was a simple, routine piece of malware. But as they and other experts around the world investigated, they discovered a mysterious virus of unparalleled complexity. <br> &nbsp;<br> They had, they soon learned, stumbled upon the world&#x2019;s first digital weapon. For Stuxnet, as it came to be known, was unlike any other virus or worm built before: Rather than simply hijacking targeted computers or stealing information from them, it escaped the digital realm to wreak actual, <i>physical </i>destruction on a nuclear facility.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> In these pages, <i>Wired </i>journalist Kim Zetter draws on her extensive sources and expertise to tell the story behind Stuxnet&#x2019;s planning, execution, and discovery, covering its genesis in the corridors of Bush&#x2019;s White House and its unleashing on systems in Iran&#x2014;and telling the spectacular, unlikely tale of the security geeks who managed to unravel a sabotage campaign years in the making. <br> &nbsp;<br> But <i>Countdown to Zero Day </i>ranges far beyond Stuxnet itself. Here, Zetter shows us how digital warfare developed in the US. She takes us inside today&#x2019;s flourishing zero-day &#x201c;grey markets,&#x201d; in which intelligence agencies and militaries pay huge sums for the malicious code they need to carry out infiltrations and attacks. She reveals just how vulnerable many of our own critical systems are to Stuxnet-like strikes, from nation-state adversaries and anonymous hackers alike&#x2014;and shows us just what might happen should our infrastructure be targeted by such an attack. <br> &nbsp;<br> Propelled by Zetter&#x2019;s unique knowledge and access, and filled with eye-opening explanations of the technologies involved, <i>Countdown to Zero Day </i>is a comprehensive and prescient portrait of a world at the edge of a new kind of war.</p><p>KIM ZETTER is an award-winning journalist who covers cybercrime, civil liberties, privacy, and security for <i>Wired</i>. She was among the first journalists to cover Stuxnet after its discovery and has authored many of the most comprehensive articles about it.

The thirty-one-year-old Belarusian has close-cropped blond hair, a lean boyish frame, and the open face and affable demeanor of someone who goes through life attracting few enemies and even fewer controversies. One of his favorite pastimes is spending the weekend at his grandmother&#x2019;s country house outside Minsk, where he decompresses from weekday stresses, far from the reach of cell phones and the internet. But in June 2010, Ulasen encountered something unusual that soon propelled him into the international spotlight and into a world of new stress.1<br><br>It was a warm Thursday afternoon, and Ulasen, who headed the antivirus division of a small computer security firm in Belarus called Virus&#x2013;BlokAda, was seated with his colleague Oleg Kupreev in their lab in downtown Minsk inside a drab, Soviet-era building about a block from the Svisloch River. They were sifting methodically through suspicious computer files they had recently found on a machine in Iran when something striking leapt out at Kupreev. He sat back in his chair and called Ulasen over to take a look. Ulasen scrolled through the code once, then again, to make sure he was seeing what he thought he saw. A tiny gasp escaped his throat. The code they had been inspecting the past few days, something they had until now considered a mildly interesting but nonetheless run-of-the-mill virus, had just revealed itself to be a work of quiet and diabolical genius.<br><br>Not only was it using a skillful rootkit to cloak itself and make it invisible to antivirus engines, it was using a shrewd zero-day exploit to propagate from machine to machine--an exploit that attacked a function so fundamental to the Windows operating system, it put millions of computers at risk of infection.<br><br>Exploits are attack code that hackers use to install viruses and other malicious tools onto machines. They take advantage of security vulnerabilities in browser software like Internet Explorer or applications like Adobe PDF Reader to slip a virus or Trojan horse onto a system, like a burglar using a crowbar to pry open a window and break into a house. If a victim visits a malicious website where the exploit lurks or clicks on a malicious e-mail attachment containing an exploit, the exploit uses the security hole in the software to drop a malicious file onto their system. When software makers learn about such holes in their products, they generally produce &#x201c;patches&#x201d; to close them up and seal the intruders out, while antivirus firms like Ulasen&#x2019;s add signatures to their scanners to detect any exploits that try to attack the vulnerabilities.<br><br>Zero-day exploits, however, aren&#x2019;t ordinary exploits but are the hacking world&#x2019;s most prized possession because they attack holes that are still unknown to the software maker and to the antivirus vendors--which means there are no antivirus signatures yet to detect the exploits and no patches available to fix the holes they attack.<br><br>But zero-day exploits are rarely found in the wild. It takes time and skill for hackers to discover new holes and write workable exploits to attack them, so the vast majority of hackers simply rely on old vulnerabilities and exploits to spread their malware, counting on the fact that most computer users don&#x2019;t often patch their machines or have up-to-date antivirus software installed, and that it can take vendors weeks or months to produce a patch for a known hole. Although more than 12 million viruses and other malicious files are captured each year, only about a dozen or so zero-days are found among them. Yet here the attackers were using an extremely valuable zero-day exploit, and a skillful rootkit, for a virus that, as far as Ulasen and Kupreev could tell, had only been found on machines in Iran so far. Something didn&#x2019;t add up.<br>THE MYSTERY FILES had come to their attention a week earlier when a reseller of VirusBlokAda&#x2019;s security software in Iran reported a persistent problem with a customer&#x2019;s machine in that country. The computer was caught in a reboot loop, crashing and rebooting repeatedly while defying the efforts of technicians to control it.2 VirusBlokAda&#x2019;s tech-support team had scanned the system remotely from Minsk to look for any malware their antivirus software might have missed, but came up with nothing. That&#x2019;s when they called in Ulasen.<br><br>Ulasen had been hired by the antivirus firm while still in college. He was hired to be a programmer, but the staff at VirusBlokAda was so small, and Ulasen&#x2019;s skills so keen, that within three years, at the age of twenty-six, he found himself leading the team that developed and maintained its antivirus engine. He also occasionally worked with the research team that deconstructed malicious threats. This was his favorite part of the job, though it was something he rarely got to do. So when the tech-support team asked him to weigh in on their mystery from Iran, he was happy to help.3<br><br>Ulasen assumed the problem must be a misconfiguration of software or an incompatibility between an application installed on the machine and the operating system. But then he learned it wasn&#x2019;t just one machine in Iran that was crashing but multiple machines, including ones that administrators had wiped clean and rebuilt with a fresh installation of the operating system. So he suspected the culprit might be a worm lurking on the victim&#x2019;s network, reinfecting scrubbed machines each time they were cleaned. He also suspected a rootkit was hiding the intruder from their antivirus engine. Ulasen had written anti-rootkit tools for his company in the past, so he was confident he&#x2019;d be able to hunt this one down if it was there.<br><br>After getting permission to connect to one of the machines in Iran and remotely examine it, Ulasen and Kupreev zeroed in on six suspicious files--two modules and four other files--they thought were the source of the problem.4 Then with help from several colleagues in their lab, they spent the next several days picking at the files in fits and starts, hurling curses at times as they struggled to decipher what turned out to be surprisingly sophisticated code. As employees of a small firm that mostly developed antivirus products for government customers, they weren&#x2019;t accustomed to taking on such complex challenges: they spent most of their days providing routine tech support to customers, not analyzing malicious threats. But they pressed forward nonetheless and eventually determined that one of the modules, a driver, was actually a &#x201c;kernel-level&#x201d; rootkit, as Ulasen had suspected.5<br><br>Rootkits come in several varieties, but the most difficult to detect are kernel-level rootkits, which burrow deep into the core of a machine to set up shop at the same privileged level where antivirus scanners work. If you think of a computer&#x2019;s structure like the concentric circles of an archer&#x2019;s target, the kernel is the bull&#x2019;s eye, the part of the operating system that makes everything work. Most hackers write rootkits that operate at a machine&#x2019;s outer layers--the user level, where applications run--because this is easier to do. But virus scanners can detect these--so a truly skilled hacker places his rootkit at the kernel level of the machine, where it can subvert the scanner. There, it serves as a kind of wingman for malicious files, running interference against scanners so the malware can do its dirty work unhindered and undetected. Kernel-level rootkits aren&#x2019;t uncommon, but it takes sophisticated knowledge and a deft touch to build one that works well. And this one worked very well.6<br><br>Kupreev determined that the rootkit was designed to hide four malicious .LNK files--the four other suspicious files they&#x2019;d found on the system in Iran. The malware appeared to be using an exploit composed of these malicious files to spread itself via infected USB flash drives, and the rootkit prevented the .LNK files from being seen on the flash drive. That&#x2019;s when Kupreev called Ulasen over to have a look.<br><br>Exploits that spread malware via USB flash drives aren&#x2019;t as common as those that spread them over the internet through websites and e-mail attachments, but they aren&#x2019;t unheard of, either. All of the USB exploits the two researchers had seen before, however, used the Autorun feature of the Windows operating system, which allowed malicious programs on a USB flash drive to execute as soon as the drive was inserted in a machine. But this exploit was more clever.7<br><br>Windows .LNK files are responsible for rendering the icons for the contents of a USB flash drive or other portable media device when it&#x2019;s plugged into a PC. Insert a USB flash drive into a PC, and Windows Explorer or a similar tool automatically scans it for .LNK files to display the icon for a music file, Word document, or program stored on the flash drive.8 But in this case, the attackers embedded an exploit in a specially crafted .LNK file so that as soon as Windows Explorer scanned the file, it triggered the exploit to spring into action to surreptitiously deposit the USB&#x2019;s malicious cargo onto the machine, like a military transport plane dropping camouflaged paratroopers onto enemy territory.<br><br>The .LNK exploit attacked such a fundamental feature of the Windows system that Ulasen wondered why no one had thought of it before. It was much worse than Autorun exploits, because those could be easily thwarted by disabling the Autorun feature on machines--a step many network administrators take as a matter of course because of Autorun&#x2019;s known security risk. But there is no way to easily disable the .LNK function without causing other problems for users.<br><br>Ulasen searched a registry of exploits for any others that had used .LNK files in the past, but came up with nothing. That was when he suspected he was looking at a zero-day.<br><br>He took a USB flash drive infected with the malicious files and plugged it into a test machine running Windows 7, the newest version of the Microsoft operating system. The machine was fully patched with all the latest security updates. If the .LNK exploit was already known to Microsoft, patches on the system would prevent it from dropping the malicious files onto the machine. But if the .LNK exploit was a zero-day, nothing would stop it. He waited a few minutes to examine the computer and, sure enough, the malicious files were there.<br><br>He couldn&#x2019;t believe it. VirusBlokAda, a tiny security firm that few in the world had ever heard of, had just discovered that rarest of trophies for a virus hunter. But this wasn&#x2019;t just any zero-day exploit; it was one that worked against every version of the Windows operating system released since Windows 2000: the attackers had bundled four versions of their exploit together--in four different .LNK files--to make sure their attack worked against every version of Windows it was likely to encounter.9<br><br>Ulasen tried to wrap his head around the number of machines that were at risk of infection from this. But then something equally troubling struck him. The malicious driver module, and another driver module that got dropped onto targeted machines as part of the malicious cargo, had installed themselves seamlessly on their test machine, without any warning notice popping up on-screen to indicate they were doing so. Windows 7 had a security feature that was supposed to tell users if an unsigned driver, or one signed with an untrusted certificate, was trying to install itself on their machine. But these two drivers had loaded with no problem. That was because, Ulasen realized with alarm, they were signed with what appeared to be a legitimate digital certificate from a company called RealTek Semiconductor.10<br><br>Digital certificates are trusted security documents, like digital passports, that software makers use to sign their programs to authenticate them as legitimate products of their company. Microsoft digitally signs its programs and software updates, as do antivirus firms. Computers assume that a file signed with a legitimate digital certificate is trustworthy. But if attackers steal a Microsoft certificate and the private cryptographic &#x201c;key&#x201d; that Microsoft uses with the certificate to sign its files, they can fool a computer into thinking their malicious code is Microsoft code.<br><br>Attackers had used digital certificates to sign malicious files before. But they had used fake, self-signed certificates masquerading as legitimate ones, or had obtained real certificates through fraudulent means, such as creating a shell company to trick a certificate authority into issuing them a certificate under the shell company&#x2019;s name.11 In both scenarios, attackers ran the risk that machines would view their certificate as suspicious and reject their file. In this case, the attackers had used a valid certificate from RealTek--a trusted hardware maker in Taiwan--to fool computers into thinking the drivers were legitimate RealTek drivers.<br><br>It was a tactic Ulasen had never seen before and it raised a lot of questions about how the attackers had pulled it off. One possibility was that they had hijacked the computer of a RealTek software developer and used his machine and credentials to get their code secretly signed.12<br><br>But it was also possible the attackers had simply stolen the signing key and certificate, or cert. For security reasons, smart companies store their certs and keys on offline servers or in hardware security modules that offered extra protection. But not everyone did this, and there were possible clues to suggest that RealTek&#x2019;s cert had indeed been nabbed. A timestamp on the certificates showed that both of the drivers had been signed on January 25, 2010. Although one of the drivers had been compiled a year earlier on January 1, 2009, the other one was compiled just six minutes before it was signed. The rapid signing suggested the attackers might have had the RealTek key and cert in their possession. There was something notable about the compilation date of this driver, however. When hackers ran their source code through a compiler to translate it into the binary code that a machine could read, the compiler often placed a timestamp in the binary file. Though attackers could manipulate the timestamp to throw researchers off, this one appeared to be legitimate. It indicated that the driver had been compiled on July 14, two days after VirusBlokAda had gone public with news of Stuxnet.<br><br>The implications were disturbing. The use of a legitimate digital certificate to authenticate malicious files undermined the trustworthiness of the computer world&#x2019;s signing architecture and called into question the legitimacy of any file signed with digital certificates thereafter. It was only a matter of time before other attackers copied the tactic and began stealing certificates as well.13 Ulasen needed to get the word out.<br><br>Responsible disclosure dictated that researchers who find vulnerabilities in software notify the relevant vendors before going public with the news to give the vendors time to patch the holes, so Ulasen dashed off e-mails to both RealTek and Microsoft, notifying them of what his team had found.<br><br>But after two weeks passed with no response from either company, Ulasen and Kupreev decided they couldn&#x2019;t keep quiet.14 The rest of the security community needed to know about the .LNK exploit. They had already added signatures to VirusBlokAda&#x2019;s antivirus engine to detect the malicious files and were seeing infections pop up on machines all over the Middle East and beyond. The worm/virus was on the run and spreading quickly. They had to go public with the news.15<br><br>1 Ulasen and his team encountered the malware the week of June 24, 2010.<br><br>2 Ulasen has never disclosed the name of the reseller, but a link on VirusBlokAda&#x2019;s website f...</p><h2>Greece in the Bronze Age</h2><p>from the arrival of the first men I Greece to the fall of the Mycenaean palace-town in the thirteenth century b.c., this work captures the essential qualities of each period of pre=classical civilization; the slow development of the Neolithic culture, the rich and original early bronz age, the fruitful yet tragic encounter between Minoans and Mycenaean empire.</p><p></p><h2>Algorithms in Java, Parts 1-4</h2><p>This is a popular textbook on algorithms and data structures now available in Java version.

Aimed at teaching the most useful insights in approaching new problems, the text avoids special methods and tricks that only work for particular problems. Intended for graduates and advanced undergraduates, it assumes only a limited familiarity with differential equations and complex variables. The presentation begins with a review of differential and difference equations, then develops local asymptotic methods for such equations, and explains perturbation and summation theory before concluding with an exposition of global asymptotic methods. Emphasizing applications, the discussion stresses care rather than rigor and relies on many well-chosen examples to teach readers how an applied mathematician tackles problems. There are 190 computer-generated plots and tables comparing approximate and exact solutions, over 600 problems of varying levels of difficulty, and an appendix summarizing the properties of special functions.</p><p><p>"This book is a reprint of the original published by McGraw-Hill \ref [MR0538168 (80d:00030)]. The only changes are the addition of the Roman numeral I to the title and the provision of a subtitle, "Asymptotic methods and perturbation theory". This latter improvement is much needed, as the original title suggested that this was a teaching book for undergraduate scientists and engineers. It is not, but is an excellent introduction to asymptotic and perturbation methods for master's degree students or beginning research students. Certain parts of it could be used for a course in asymptotics for final year undergraduates in applied mathematics or mathematical physics. <br><br>This is a book that has stood the test of time and I cannot but endorse the remarks of the original reviewer.

But was Steve really the lookout who gave the "all clear" to the murderer, or was he just in the wrong place at the wrong time? In this innovative novel by Walter Dean Myers, the reader becomes both juror and witness during the trial of Steve's life. To calm his nerves as he sits in the courtroom, aspiring filmmaker Steve chronicles the proceedings in movie script format. Interspersed throughout his screenplay are journal writings that provide insight into Steve's life before the murder and his feelings about being held in prison during the trial. "They take away your shoelaces and your belt so you can't kill yourself no matter how bad it is. I guess making you live is part of the punishment."<p> Myers, known for the inner-city classic <i>Motown and Didi</i> (first published in 1984), proves with <i>Monster</i> that he has kept up with both the struggles and the lingo of today's teens. Steve is an adolescent caught up in the violent circumstances of an adult world--a situation most teens can relate to on some level. Readers will no doubt be attracted to the novel's handwriting-style typeface, emphasis on dialogue, and fast-paced courtroom action. By weaving together Steve's journal entries and his script, Myers has given the first-person voice a new twist and added yet another worthy volume to his already admirable body of work.

In<em> Darwin Devolves,</em> Behe advances his argument, presenting new research that offers a startling reconsideration of how Darwin&#x2019;s mechanism works, weakening the theory&#x2019;s validity even more. </p><p>A system of natural selection acting on random mutation, evolution can help make something look and act differently. But evolution never creates something organically. Behe contends that Darwinism actually works by a process of devolution&#x2014;damaging cells in DNA in order to create something new at the lowest biological levels. This is important, he makes clear, because it shows the Darwinian process cannot explain the creation of life itself. &#x201c;A process that so easily tears down sophisticated machinery is not one which will build complex, functional systems,&#x201d; he writes.</p><p>In addition to disputing the methodology of Darwinism and how it conflicts with the concept of creation, Behe reveals that what makes Intelligent Design unique&#x2014;and right&#x2014;is that it acknowledges causation. Evolution proposes that organisms living today are descended with modification from organisms that lived in the distant past. But Intelligent Design goes a step further asking, what caused such astounding changes to take place? What is the reason or mechanism for evolution? For Behe, this is what makes Intelligent Design so important.</p></p><p><p><strong>MICHAEL BEHE</strong>&nbsp;is a biochemist, intelligent design advocate, and author of <em>Darwin&#x2019;s Black Box </em>and <em>Edge of Evolution. </em>He is a professor of biochemistry at Lehigh University, and a founding Senior Fellow of Discovery Institute&#x2019;s Center for Science and Culture. </p>&#x201c;I highly recommend this book to both proponents and skeptics of Darwinian evolution as it will open new avenues of thought and creativity regarding this important subject.&#x201d; (<strong>Russell Carlson, professor emeritus of biochemistry and molecular biology at the University of Georgia</strong>)<br><br>&#x201c;Behe&#x2019;s latest masterpiece takes the evidence marshaled in defense of the unbounded power of blind evolution and deftly brings it to the opposite conclusion: evolution is self-limiting <em>by design</em>. Time for the Behe-bashers to retire.&#x201d; (<strong>Douglas Axe, director of Biologic Institute and author of <em>Undeniable</em></strong>)<br><br>&#x201c;Behe introduces new molecular-level facts that sink the Darwinian view of life once and for all: Darwinian mechanism sometimes helps survival of an organism but always by damaging or breaking genes. The conclusion is clear: life is the product of a mind.&#x201d; (<strong>Matti Leisola,&nbsp;DSc, professor emeritus of bioprocess engineering at Aalto University, Finland</strong>)<br><br><em>&#x201c;Darwin Devolves&nbsp;</em>is a must read.&nbsp;Behe presents comprehensive and convincing arguments that genomic reduction is responsible for numerous classic examples of species adaptive radiation, challenging Darwin&#x2019;s &#x2018;mutation and selection&#x2019; mechanism as the source of life&#x2019;s diversity.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<strong>Scott A.

A cultural metaphor is any activity, phenomenon, or institution that members of a given culture consider important and with which they identify emotionally and/or cognitively, such as the Japanese garden and American football. This cultural metaphoric approach identifies three to eight unique or distinctive features of each cultural metaphor and then discusses 34 national cultures in terms of these features.

It is regarded as an important early work of American feminist literature, illustrating attitudes in the 19th century toward women's health, both physical and mental.<br><br> Presented in the first person, the story is a collection of journal entries written by a woman whose physician husband (John) has rented an old mansion for the summer. Foregoing other rooms in the house, the couple moves into the upstairs nursery. As a form of treatment she is forbidden from working, and is encouraged to eat well and get plenty of exercise and air, so she can recuperate from what he calls a "temporary nervous depression - a slight hysterical tendency", a diagnosis common to women in that period. She hides her journal from her husband and his sister the housekeeper, fearful of being reproached for overworking herself. The room's windows are barred to prevent children from climbing through them, and there is a gate across the top of the stairs, though she and her husband have access to the rest of the house and its adjoining estate.<br><br> The story depicts the effect of under-stimulation on the narrator's mental health and her descent into psychosis. With nothing to stimulate her, she becomes obsessed by the pattern and color of the wallpaper. "It is the strangest yellow, that wall-paper! It makes me think of all the yellow things I ever saw - not beautiful ones like buttercups, but old foul, bad yellow things. But there is something else about that paper - the smell! ... The only thing I can think of that it is like is the color of the paper! A yellow smell." . . .

His various manipulations of the credulous rich have made him rich in turn. His travels take him to France, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy.

His parents, both actors, wanted him to become a priest, but their hopes were dashed when, at sixteen, he was expelled from seminary for immoral misconduct. Probably best-known for his reputation as a womanizer, Casanova was in turn a secretary, a soldier in the Venetian army, a preacher, an alchemist, a gambler, a violinist, a lottery director, and a spy. He translated Homer's <i>Iliad</i> into Italian and collaborated with Da Ponte on the libretto for Mozart's <i>Don Giovanni</i>. He retired in 1785 to the castle of a friend&#x2015;Count Waldstein of Bohemia&#x2015;in order to write his memoirs.</p></p><h2>Voluptuous Panic: The Erotic World of Weimar Berlin</h2><p>Between 1921 and 1933, Berlin developed a reputation for debauchery unrivaled by any city before or since. Unlike European capitals like Paris, Barcelona, and Amsterdam, where brothel districts were extensive but discreet, in Berlin sexual tourism was a primary industry. On any given evening, over 600 establishments, from massage parlors to sex clubs to cabarets to private torture dungeons, promised unique sights and pleasures. Using tourist guidebooks that appeared before the Nazi period, historical memoirs, and more than 400 specialized journals and books, Mel Gordon has put together a controversial exploration of Berlin&#39;s erotic demiworld and its relationship to the rise of Nazism.</p><p>Mel Gordon is Professor of Theater Arts at the University of California, Berkeley. He is the author of twelve books, including &#34;The Grand Guignol,&#34; &#34;Dada Performance,&#34; &#34;The Stanislavsky Technique,&#34; and the Feral House titles, &#34;Erik Jan Hanussen: Hitler&#39;s Jewish Clairvoyant&#34; and &#34;The Seven Addictions and Five Professions of Anita Berber.&#34;An intriguing cache of recently discovered erotica from 1920s Berlin (photographs, theater programs, guidebooks and pictorial magazines) is on display in Voluptuous Panic: The Erotic World of Weimar Berlin. U.C. Berkeley theater professor Mel Gordon (The Grand Guignol) enhances the compelling visual images with snippets of personal memoirs, interviews and other sociological accounts that describe a sexually charged city brimming with prolific prostitution, homosexuality and drugs in the heady days before the Nazis came into full power. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Introduction to Phonetics and Phonology: From Concepts to Transcription</h2><p><p> <b> <i> <b>Introduction to Phonetics and Phonology: From Concepts to Transcription </b> </i>provides readers with&nbsp;a basic foundation in both phonetics and phonology.&nbsp; The book has two goals:&nbsp; (1) to connect phonetics and phonology into a conceptual unity and (2) to demonstrate the practical relevance of phonetics, phonology, and phonetic transcription for beginning students in communication disorders and related disciplines, such as linguistics or education.&nbsp; </b> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Written with an abundance of real-life examples, this first edition provides readers with a large base of information, from the basic definitions of phonetics and phonology to their practical, clinical applications when analyzing speech samples, demonstrating to future speech language practioners the interconnection between these two areas of of the field.&nbsp;&nbsp;The text's&nbsp;uniqueness lies in the continuous application of the presented information to practical examples, reinforcing to students the relevance of this knowledge to clinical practice while providing&nbsp;the instructor with practical examples which can be used to demonstrate basic principles.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>An important feature of this book is the inclusion of &nbsp;a phonetic transcription workbook.&nbsp; This workbook guides the student through a systematic learning process beginning with the identification of sounds within words, as opposed to letters, to transcribing multisyllabic words and short phrases.&nbsp; The process is a step-by-step one in which vowels and consonants are introduced in small groups, words are selected based on these sounds, followed by listening and transcription practice.&nbsp; Additional sounds are added systematically and each unit builds upon the next.

Grant describes how a reluctant soldier became the triumphant leader who led the Union to victory in the Civil War.</p><p>Albert Marrin is Chairman of the History Department at Yeshiva University.Dramatic yet well balanced, a biography framed by chapters outlining Grant's earlier and later life while focusing on his major military campaigns and offering perspectives of civilians in charge as well as of generals and the soldiers who carried out their orders. The author is particularly effective in depicting motivations, whether of patriotic ordinary soldiers or scheming generals; he points out that Lee personally abhorred both slavery and secession but felt honor bound to defend his home state, while Lincoln, Grant, and other Union generals insisted that they were fighting only to preserve the Union. Graphically, he portrays the waste and slaughter that destroyed young soldiers' visions of easy victories, and the sufferings of civilians in this first ``total war.'' Moving effortlessly from one viewpoint to another, Marrin considers Grant's mistakes and failures along with his hard-won successes, humanizing his portrait with details of a loving family life and struggles with political and military enemies. An excellent complement to Jim Murphy's The Boy's War (1990). Contemporary illustrations (mostly portraits); source notes; extensive bibliography; index.

It also features a large portion of his essays and letters and an introduction by Wilde&#39;s son, Vyvyan Holland.</p><p><br> <p>Born in Ireland in 1856, Oscar Wilde was a noted essayist, playwright, fairy tale writer and poet, as well as an early leader of the Aesthetic Movement. His plays include: <em>An Ideal Husband, Salome, A Woman of No Importance,</em> and <em>Lady Windermere's Fan.</em> Among his best known stories are <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em> and <em>The Canterville Ghost</em>.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p><b>The Picture Of Dorian Gray</b></p><p>The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there came through the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate perfume of the pink-flowering thorn.</p><p>From the corner of the divan of' Persian saddle-bags on which he was lying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flame-like as theirs ; and now and then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window, producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him think of those pallid jade-faced painters of Tokio who, through the medium of an art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of swiftness and motion. The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their way through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine, seemed to make the stillness more oppressive. The dim roar of London was like the bourdon note of a distant organ.</p><p>In the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the full-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty, and in front of it, some little distance away, was sitting the artist himself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years ago caused, at the time, such public excitement, and gave rise to so many strange conjectures.</p><p>As the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so skilfully mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his face, and seemed about to linger there. But he suddenly started up, and, closing his eyes, placed his fingers upon the lids, as though he sought to imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he feared he might awake.</p><p>"It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done," said Lord Henry, languidly. " You must certainly send it next year to the Grosvenor. The Academy is too large and too vulgar. Whenever I have gone there, there have been either so many people that I have not been able to see the pictures, which was dreadful, or so many pictures that I have not been able to see the people, which was worse. The Grosvenor is really the only place."</p><p>"I don't think I shall send it anywhere," he answered, tossing his head back in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh at him at Oxford. " No : I won't send it anywhere."</p><p>Lord Henry elevated his eyebrows, and looked at him in amazement through the thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such </p><p>fanciful whirls from his heavy opium-tainted cigarette. " Not send it anywhere ? My dear fellow, why ? Have you any reason ? What odd chaps you painters are ! You do anything in the world to gain a reputation. As soon as you have one, you seem to want to throw it away. It is silly of you, for there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about. A portrait like this would set you far above all the young men in England, and make the old men quite jealous, if old men are ever capable of any emotion."</p><p>"I know you will laugh at me," he replied, " but I really can't exhibit it. I have put too much of myself into it."</p><p>Lord Henry stretched himself out on the divan and laughed.</p><p>"Yes, I knew you would ; but it is quite true, all the same."</p><p>"Too much of yourself in it ! Upon my word, Basil, I didn't know you were so vain ; and I really can't see any resemblance between you, with your rugged strong face and your coal-black hair, and this young</p><p>Adonis, who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose-leaves. Why, my dear Basil, he is a Narcissus, and you-well, of course you have an intellectual expression, and all that. But beauty, real beauty, ends where an intellectual expression begins. Intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face. The moment one sits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all forehead, or something horrid. Look at the successful men in any of the learned professions. How perfectly hideous they are! Except, of course, in the Church. But then in the Church they don't think. A bishop keeps on saying at the age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen, and as a natural consequence he a-ways looks absolutely delightful. Your mysterious young friend, whose name you have never told me, but whose picture really fascinates me, never thinks. I feel quite sure of that. He is some brainless, beautiful creature, who should be always here in winter when we have no flowers to look at, and always here in summer when we want something to chill our intelligence. Don't flatter yourself, Basil : you are not in the least like him."</p><p>"You don't understand me, Harry," answered the artist. " O course I am not like him. I know that perfectly well. Indeed, I should be sorry to look like him. You shrug your shoulders ? I am telling you the truth. There is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction, the sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering steps of kings. It is better not to be different from one's fellows. The ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world. They can sit at their ease and gape at the play.</p></p><h2>The Organic Gardener&#39;s Handbook of Natural Insect and Disease Control: A Complete Problem-Solving Guide to Keeping Your Garden and Yard Healthy Without Chemicals</h2><p>End your worries about garden problems with safe, effective solutions from <i>The Organic Gardener's Handbook of Natural Insect and Disease Control</i>!<br><br>* Easy-to-use problem-solving encyclopedia covers more than 200 vegetables, fruits, herbs, flowers, trees, and shrubs<br>* Complete directions on how, when, and where to use preventive methods, insect traps and barriers, biocontrols, homemade remedies, botanical insecticides, and more<br>* More than 350 color photos for quick identification of insect pests, beneficial insects, and plant diseases<br><br>Newly revised with the latest, safest organic controls.<br><br>A <i>New York Times</i> Best Gardening Book</p><p>&#x201c;This book is our most helpful resource on pest control.

Tavi&#x2019;s career in media began when she created the style blog thestylerookie.com in 2008, when she was 11. In 2011, at 15, Tavi launched Rookie, an online magazine for teenage girls. Six days after its debut, Rookie received more than one million pageviews. Tavi has since spoken at TEDxTeen, the&nbsp;<i>Economist</i>'s The World in 2011, and the Sydney Opera House. Lady Gaga has called her "the future of journalism."&nbsp;Editor Gevinson, known to fans, friends, her parents, and teachers simply as Tavi, is way, way cooler than the coolest kid you went to high school with. Last year, with a little help from her friends, she launched online magazine Rookie. This title compiles the site&#x2019;s &#x201c;very best&#x201d; offerings through May 2012.

One of the best-loved contributors to the latter--the magazine's own brand of gossip column--was Maeve Brennan who, from 1954 to 1981, offered her wry observations of New York life under the sobriquet "The Long-Winded Lady." This compendium of her articles was first published in 1969 and is now reprinted with the addition of nine more previously uncollected pieces. The result is the answer to every "Talk of the Town"-lover's prayer. <p> Take, for example, "A Young Man with a Menu," in which Brennan watches "a young man persuade a girl to join him for dinner by reading the menu to her over the telephone." She describes the restaurant, Longchamps, as "ready-made for episodes of intrigue and pursuit" and the first appearance of the young man--"his expression as he entered the restaurant said that he was intent on something--one thing--and indifferent to everything else." She takes us through the phone call, which she observes from a distance: "He read from all sections of the menu. I had a menu of my own, so I could tell just about where he was." But, typically Brennan-like, she ushers us out of the piece just as the girl arrives, without letting us "even see the color of her hair." Every piece in this collection is as precise and as surprising as this one; anyone who loves New York, <i>The New Yorker</i>, or Maeve Brennan will savor <i>The Long-Winded Lady</i>. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Maeve Brennan came to America from Ireland in 1934, when she was seventeen. From 1949 through the mid-1970s, she was on the staff of The New Yorker, where she made memorable contributions to &#34;The Talk of the Town&#34; under the pen name &#34;The Long-Winded Lady.&#34; She died in New York in 1993.</p><h2>Illustrated Guide to Trees and Shrubs: A Handbook of the Woody Plants of the Northeastern United States and Adjacent Canada/Revised Edition</h2><p>"Excellent keys, superbly drawn illustrations.

Wiley, American Museum of Natural History<br>Nature lovers will welcome this authoritative, easily accessible guide to all woody plants &#x2014; trees, shrubs, or vines &#x2014; both wild and cultivated, commonly found in the Northeastern United States and adjacent parts of Canada.

The plan nearly succeeded, and almost certainly would have, were it not for one small Belgian town and its tenacious American defenders who held back a tenfold larger German force while awaiting the arrival of General George Patton&#x2019;s mighty Third Army.<br><br> In this dramatic account of the 1944&#x2013;45 winter of war in Bastogne, historian Peter Schrijvers offers the first full story of the German assault on the strategically located town. From the December stampede of American and Panzer divisions racing to reach Bastogne first, through the bloody eight-day siege from land and air, and through three more weeks of unrelenting fighting even after the siege was broken, events at Bastogne hastened the long-awaited end of WWII. Schrijvers draws on diaries, memoirs, and other fresh sources to illuminate the experiences not only of Bastogne&#x2019;s 3,000 citizens and their American defenders, but also of German soldiers and commanders desperate for victory. The costs of war are here made real, uncovered in the stories of those who perished and those who emerged from battle to find the world forever changed.</p><p><b>Peter Schrijvers,</b> a senior lecturer at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, is the author of five previous books on World War II."A fast-paced story. . . .

Thacker, <i>The Bowling Green Daily News</i><br>"A lively account of the fighting."&#x2014;Lawrence D. Freedman,&nbsp;<i>Foreign Affairs</i><br>"An excellent account of the battle for Bastogne, both well-researched and well-written."&#x2014;Antony Beevor<br>"Using fresh sources and deft writing, Peter Schrijvers develops a panoramic and compelling boots-on-the-ground illumination of one of the Bulge's most epic battles."&#x2014;Patrick K. O'Donnell, author of <i>Dog Company: The Boys of Pointe du Hoc - Rangers Who Accomplished D-Day's Toughest Mission and Led the Way Across Europe </i><br>"Bastogne was a month-long battle of attrition, a desperate grapple between Germans and Americans. Yet until now its tale has never been told separately. Schrijvers combines clear operational narrative with compelling vignettes from three perspectives: those who fought to hold Bastogne, those who sought to capture it, and those caught in the crossfire. Soldiers or civilians, their stories establish war&#x2019;s human dimension &#x2013; and its inhuman face."&#x2014;Dennis Showalter, author of <i>Hitler's Panzers. The Lightning Attacks that Revolutionized Warfare</i><br>"It provides a more vivid and nuanced picture of the crucial fighting for control of Bastogne than any other book."&#x2014;James J. Weingartner, author of <i>Crossroads of Death: The Story of the Malmedy Massacre and Trial</i><br>"Peter Schrijvers writes with the confidence and authority of someone who has been immersed in the subject for many years. His effective use of vivid civilian testimony means one sees the Battle of the Bulge through the eyes of the Belgians caught up in it, as well as of the American and German troops."&#x2014;Jonathan Fryer, writer and broadcaster<br></p><h2>Kings and Things</h2><p>Takes us through the highs and lows of British History.</p><p>Surprisingly little is known about the life of Henrietta Elizabeth Marshall.

From gloomy Upper West Side apartments to the pastel Yiddish resorts of Miami, Singer covers the territory of American Jewry in the aftermath of the Holocaust in this impressively expansive novel.<br></p><p>Although Isaac Bashevis Singer emigrated from Poland to the United States in 1935, the circumscribed world of the Polish Jews remained at the heart of his imagination. Beginning with his first major work, <i>Satan in Goray</i> (1935), he used the life of the <i>shtetl</i> as raw material, transforming its folkways, religious practices, superstitions, and sexual habits into superior works of art. From time to time, however, Singer turned his eye upon New World Jews like himself, recording their rapid or reluctant assimilation into the American mainstream. One such book is <i>Shadows on the Hudson</i>. <p> This massive novel originally was serialized in the Yiddish-language <i>Jewish Daily Forward</i> in 1957. Now it has finally been translated into English--in a capable version by Joseph Sherman--and Singer fans should be very grateful. Center stage is occupied by Boris Makaver, a master builder equally devoted to I-beams and the Talmud, and Anna, his much-married daughter. Fanning out from this duo, however, is a small universe of refugees, all of them served up with Singer's customary brio. (Here's a comical snapshot of a shyster named Hertz Grein: "His nose had a Jewish hook, but then had second thoughts and straightened itself out. His lips were thin, and his blue eyes revealed a curious mixture of bashfulness, sharpness, and something else that was hard to define. Margolin used to say that he looked like a Yeshiva boy from Scandinavia.") As the subplots pile up in an unruly heap, the novel sometimes reveals its installment-plan origins. Still, Singer puts his large cast through some wonderful paces, and the endless talk--for these are characters who truly come alive through the medium of rapid, contentious, Yiddish-accented conversation--allows the author to speculate about destiny, identity, and freedom without slowing his story a whit. As Singer said more than once, "Of course I believe in free will. Do we have a choice?"</p><b>Isaac&nbsp; Bashevis Singer</b> (1904-91)&nbsp; was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1978.</p><h2>The Mediterranean Method: Your Complete Plan to Harness the Power of the Healthiest Diet on the Planet-- Lose Weight, Prevent Heart Disease, and More!

It brought him to the forefront of the antislavery movement and drew thousands, black and white, to the cause. Written in part as a response to skeptics who refused to believe that so articulate an orator could ever have been a slave, the <i>Narrative </i>reveals the eloquence and fierce intelligence that made Douglass a brilliantly effective spokesman for abolition and equal rights, as he shapes an inspiring vision of self-realization in the face of unimaginable odds.</p><p>Douglass escaped slavery in 1838 and became a tireless campaigner for abolitionism. This autobiography lays bare the realities of slavery in antebellum America. The eloquence of Douglass&#39; writing, with an immediacy and honesty found shocking at the time, make this an invaluable record of one of humanity&#39;s most shameful acts.This book is in Electronic Paperback Format.

Nine brilliant and bold historians present a dynamic picture of cultures in transition and in the process scrutinize a myriad of subjects&#x2015;the sacrament of confession, volunteer hotlines, Nazi policies toward the family, the baby boom, evolving sexuality, the history of contraception, and ever-changing dress codes. They draw upon many unexpected sources, including divorce hearing transcripts, personal ads, and little-known demographic and consumer data.</p><p>Perhaps the most notable pattern to emerge is a polarizing of public and private realms. Productive labor shifts from the home to an impersonal public setting. Salaried or corporate employment replaces many independent, entrepreneurial jobs, and workers of all kinds aggressively pursue their leisure time&#x2015;coffee and lunch breaks, weekends, vacations. Zoning laws segregate industrial and commercial areas from residential neighborhoods, which are no longer a supportive &#x201c;theater&#x201d; of benign surveillance, gossip, and mutual concern, but an assemblage of aloof and anonymous individuals or families. Scattered with personal possessions and appliances, homes grow large by yesterday's standards and are marked by elaborate spatial subdivisions; privacy is now possible even among one's own family. Men and women are obsessed with health, fitness, diet, and appearance as the body becomes the focal point of personal identity. Mirrors, once a rarity, are ubiquitous. In the search for sexual and individualistic fulfillment, romantic love becomes the foundation of marriage. Couples marry at an older age; families are smaller. The divorce rate rises, and with it the number of single-parent households. Women, entering the workforce in unprecedented numbers, frequently function as both breadwinner and homemaker. The authors interrelate these dramatic patterns with the changing roles of state and religion in family matters, the socialization of education and elder care, the growth of feminism, the impact of media on private life, and the nature of secrecy.</p><p>Comprehensive and astute, <i>Riddles of Identity in Modern Times</i> chronicles a period when the differentiation of life into public and private realms, once a luxury of the wealthy, gradually spread throughout the population.

Written in the 1930s and first discovered by the English-speaking world after the fall of communism in Hungary, B�nffy&#x2019;s novels were translated in the late 1990s to critical acclaim and appear here for the first time in hardcover.<br><br><i>They Were Found Wanting </i>and <i>They Were Divided, </i>the second and third novels in the trilogy, continue the story of the two aristocratic cousins introduced in <i>They Were Counted </i>as they navigate a dissolute society teetering on the brink of catastrophe. Count Balint Ab�dy, a liberal politician who defends his homeland&#x2019;s downtrodden Romanian peasants, loses his beautiful lover, Adrienne, who is married to a sinister and dangerously insane man, while his cousin L�szl� loses himself in reckless and self-destructive addictions. Meanwhile, no one seems to notice the gathering clouds that are threatening the Austro-Hungarian Empire and that will soon lead to the brutal dismemberment of their country. Set amid magnificent scenery of wild forests, snowcapped mountains, and ancient castles, THE TRANSYLVANIAN TRILOGY combines a Proustian nostalgia for a lost world, insight into a collapsing empire reminiscent of the work of Joseph Roth, and the drama and epic sweep of Tolstoy.</p><p><b>Count Mikl�s B�nffy</b> (1873-1950) was a Hungarian nobleman with extensive estates in Hungarian Transylvania (now Romania). He was the first patron of composer B�la Bart�k and briefly Hungarian foreign minister after World War I. His castle and great library were deliberately destroyed by the retreating Nazis in 1944.<i>Excerpted from Volume II, Part I, Chapter I<br></i><br>One day in the autumn of 1906 the Budapest Parliament was unusually well attended. In fact the Chamber was packed, with not an empty seat to be seen. On the front benches, the government was there in full force. It was, of course, an important day for that morning the Budget was to be presented and everyone knew that, for the first time since 1903, it was bound to be passed and, more important still, passed by a massive majority. For the previous three years the country&#x2019;s finances had been ordered by &#x2018;indemnities&#x2019; &#x2013; unconstitutional decrees, which had mockingly become known in pig Latin as &#x2018;<i>exlex&#x2019;</i> for the sake of the rhyme, and which had had a disastrous effect on the economy.<br> &nbsp;<br> At last, and this had been the great achievement of the Coalition government, the nation had put its house in order.<br> &nbsp;<br> Pal Hoitsy, the Speaker, ascended the podium, his handsome grey head and well-trimmed imperial looking well against the oak panelling behind the platform. In stilted words he commented on the importance of this blessed situation in which confidence had been restored ben the nation and the King, the Emperor Franz-Josef in Vienna.<br> &nbsp;<br> A few meagre &#x2018;hurrahs&#x2019; came from a handful of enthusiastic members, though the rest of the House remained silent, stony- faced and stern. None of the political groups &#x2013; not even the minorities party whose leader, the Serbian Mihaly Polit, was to propose acceptance of the Budget &#x2013; gave the smallest sign of believing the Speaker&#x2019;s words. The reason was that that morning, September 22nd, an article had appeared in the Viennese news- paper Fremdenblatt baldly stating that this much-vaunted harmony was nothing more than a cynical and dishonest political fiction.<br> &nbsp;<br> The article concentrated on the resolution which had been drafted on the previous day by the legal committee of the Minis- try of Justice and which, so everyone had been led to believe, would be incorporated into law at today&#x2019;s session.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was a delicate and disagreeable situation.<br> &nbsp;<br> The difficulties had started two days before when a member of the People&#x2019;s Party had proposed that the recently resigned government of General Fejervary should be impeached. The new government, much though it would have liked to do so, could not now avoid a debate on the proposal (as it had done the previous July when similar propositions had been put forward by the towns and counties at the time of the great debate on the Address), especially as the proposer was a member of Rakovsky&#x2019;s intimate circle. Naturally the government suspected that the latter was behind this latest move and it was believed too that the whole manoeuvre had been plotted in Ferenc Kossuth&#x2019;s camp of treachery and was intended to breed such confusion and doubt that the newly achieved harmony of the Coalition would be endangered. This was indeed a direct attack just where the new administration was most vulnerable. Everyone now professed to know that one of the conditions of the recent transfer of power had been that no harm should come to members of the previous government. The leaders of the Coalition had accepted this condition since their object was to restore good relations between the nation and the ruler and the government of General Fejervary had been appointed by the King. That this agreement had been made was not, until now, public knowledge and indeed had been expressly denied during the summer when Laszlo Voros, Minister of the Economy in Fejervary&#x2019;s so-called &#x2018;Bodyguard&#x2019; government, had first announced the existence of the Pactum, the settlement of differences between the royal nominees and the elected representatives. These denials had then been in somewhat vague terms, but now the matter had been brought out into the open. The new government&#x2019;s problem was how openly to face the situation provoked by the People&#x2019;s Party representative, offer a solution that would content the opposition, and at the same time keep their word to the King.<br> &nbsp;<br> Everyone&#x2019;s face was saved by the intervention of Ferenc Kossuth, who boldly risked his reputation in the discussion in the committee when he declared that no Pactum existed since secret agreements of that sort were unconstitutional. This was a dangerous statement to make since everyone knew that for the King to have made the new appointments, agreement must have been reached on specific points such as this; but it sounded well and so dignity had been maintained by oratory. As a result it was planned that the House would reject the impeachment proposal and instead give its approval to an official statement which branded Fejervary and his cabinet as &#x2018;disloyal counsellors of the King and nation&#x2019; and delivered them to the &#x2018;scornful judgement of history&#x2019;. It was further decided that this official statement should be everywhere displayed on posters.<br> &nbsp;<br> The formula was a good one and all the committee members had left the meeting satisfied in their own ways; the radicals because the hated &#x2018;Bodyguard&#x2019; government would be publicly degraded, and the new cabinet because they were no longer faced with a constitutional obligation to initiate an impeachment which would be most embarrassing to them.<br> &nbsp;<br> But now, when everyone had breathed a sigh of relief and thought that the difficulties had been solved, the bomb had been exploded in the leading article of the Fremdenblatt, which was known to be the semi-official mouthpiece of the Court in Vienna. Here it was declared that, &#x2018;according to well-informed sources in Budapest&#x2019;, the previous day&#x2019;s committee decision would not be presented in its agreed form since it was unthinkable that those who enjoyed the ruler&#x2019;s confidence should be put publicly in the pillory. It was further declared, and this was said to have come from someone &#x2018;close to Fejervary&#x2019;, that the former Minister-President would himself speak at the next session of the House of Lords and that he would then explain the full details of the Pactum.<br> &nbsp;<br> No more. No less.<br> &nbsp;<br> There was an atmosphere of gloom in the Chamber. The weather outside was grim and autumnal and little light filtered down through the glass-covered ceiling. The lamps were lit that illuminated the galleries on the first floor and the seats reserved for the press, and these too added to the lack-lustre effect for, although here and there faint reflection could be caught from all the panels of imitation marble and the gilding on the capitals, there were great areas of shadow which made the vast hall seem even darker than it was. Even the painted plaster statues could hardly be seen. Only the Speaker&#x2019;s silvery hair shone on the platform.<br> &nbsp;<br> Out of bored good manners the members remained seated in their places; but everyone was preoccupied with their own thoughts and they hardly heard the Speaker&#x2019;s rolling phrases. In many parts of the Chamber five or six heads were bent towards each other as little groups discussed in whispers the new turn of events revealed by the Fremdenblatt and the menace that lurked between the lines of the article. Only Minister-President Wekerle leaned back calmly in his chair, his handsome face, which was so reminiscent of that of an ancient Roman emperor, turned attentively in the direction of the Speaker. As the architect of the Budget which was everywhere acclaimed he was, no doubt, contemplating the triumph of its acceptance; but his manner was that of a man who has weathered many a storm and whose nerves were firmly under control.<br> &nbsp;<br> How the world has changed, thought Balint Abady who, as an independent, sat high up in the seats opposite the Speaker. What storms would have raged here a year and a half ago! How every- one would have jumped about shouting impromptu phrases, raging against the accursed influence of Vienna and the sinister &#x2018;Camarilla&#x2019; that ruled the Court. Then even the Speaker would have made some reference to the &#x2018;illegal interference by a foreign newspaper!&#x2019; Perhaps they saw things more clearly now that they knew more of what is really going on . . . perhaps at last they were beginning to learn.<br> &nbsp;<br> With these thoughts in his head he listened to what the Speaker was saying.<br> &nbsp;<br> As the speech was coming to an end someone from the seats of the 1848 Party came over and sat beside him. It was Dr Zsigmond Boros, the lawyer who was Member for Marosvasarhely. Dr Boros&#x2019;s political career had started well. After his election in 1904 he had become one of the chief spokesmen for the extreme left and when the Coalition government was formed he had been appointed an Under-Secretary of State under Kossuth. After two months of office, however, he had suddenly resigned without giving any reason. Gossip had it that his legal practice was involved in some shady dealings, though no one knew anything specific about the matter. Nevertheless, he found himself cold-shouldered by many of his fellow members for, in those days, while any amount of political chicanery would be tolerated, people were puritanically strict about personal honesty. Boros had only occasionally been seen in the House since his resignation from office and it had been assumed that he had been busy putting his affairs in order. Two days before the present session he had reappeared. Abady had noticed that since his return he had held little conferences with one group or another, obviously explaining something and then moving on to talk to other people. Now he had come to Abady and sat down next to him. He must have some special reason, thought Balint.</p><h2>Steck-Vaughn Social Studies � 2004: Student Edition Regions of Our Country</h2><p>Explore the beauty of regions around the United States.

Lean efforts at most companies focus on point kaizen (e.g., reducing set up times, implementing 5S, etc.) that improves a small portion of the value stream running from raw materials to finished products. Or they focus on flow kaizen that improves the entire value stream for one product family. Creating Level Pull shows how companies can make the leap to system kaizen by introducing a lean production control system that ties together the flows of information and materials supporting every product family in a facility. With this system in place, each production activity requests precisely the materials it needs from the previous activity, and demand from the customer is leveled to smooth production activities throughout the plant. Creating Level Pull is written in plain English and walks you through the implementation process using a clear question-and-answer format, supported by diagrams, value-stream maps, and key formulas. Using a realistic example facility, the author shows you how to make the transition to a robust pull system. This involves answering a series of 12 critical questions including what items to hold in finished goods inventory and what items to make to order, how to buffer the system against instability, how to schedule batch processes, and how to level the production schedule. Careful attention to leveling (called heijunka) permits facilities to accommodate variations in demand with minimum inventories, capital costs, manpower, and production lead time.</p><p><p>The Creating Level Pull workbook shows you how to advance a lean transformation from a focus on isolated improvements to improving the entire plantwide production system by implementing a lean production control system.</p><p>The workbook is unique because it is a step-by-step case study on how to implement a level, pull-based production control system,&#x201d; said author Art Smalley.

For the first time in this edition, How To examples appear before the paired Examples and You Try It problems--a hallmark feature found in all other books in the Aufmann series. Presenting students with worked examples, and then providing them with the opportunity to immediately solve similar problems, helps them build their confidence and eventually master the concepts. Simplicity is key in the organization of this edition, as in all other editions. All lessons, exercise sets, tests, and supplements are organized around a carefully constructed hierarchy of objectives. Each exercise mirrors a preceding objective, which helps to reinforce key concepts and promote skill building. This clear, objective-based approach allows students to organize their thoughts around the content, and supports instructors as they work to design syllabi, lesson plans, and other administrative documents. New features like Focus on Success, Apply the Concept, and Concept Check add an increased emphasis on study skills and conceptual understanding to strengthen the foundation of student success.

This introduction explains state insurance licensing programs in general and talks about how the <i>Exam Cram </i>series can help you prepare for your state insurance licensing exam. Chapters 1&#x2013;19 are designed to remind you of everything you need to know in order to take&#x2014;and pass&#x2014;your state insurance licensing exam. The two practice exams at the end of the book should give you a reasonably accurate assessment of your knowledge&#x2014;and, yes, we've provided the answers and their explanations to the tests. Read the book and understand the material, and you'll stand a very good chance of passing the test.</p> <p> <i>Exam Cram</i> books help you understand and appreciate the subjects and materials you need to pass state insurance licensing exams. <i>Exam Cram</i> books are aimed strictly at test preparation and review. They do not teach you everything you need to know to pass the exam. Instead, this book presents and dissects the questions and problems you're likely to encounter on a test. We've worked to bring together as much information as possible about state insurance licensing exams into one study guide that includes everything you need to prepare the exams.</p> <p>Nevertheless, to completely prepare yourself for any state insurance licensing test, we recommend that you follow the recommendations in the Self-Assessment included in this book, immediately following this introduction. The review questions, practice exams, and optional study materials described in the Self-Assessment can help you evaluate your knowledge base against the requirements for a state insurance licensing exam under both ideal and real circumstances.</p> <p>Based on what you learn from the Self-Assessment, you might decide to begin your studies with some more comprehensive self-study or classroom training, some practice with state insurance exam simulators, or an audio review program. On the other hand, you might decide to pick up and read one of the many study guides available from third-party vendors on certain</p> <p>topics. We also recommend that you supplement your study program with a visit to your state insurance department's website to get all the details about how to obtain your insurance license as well as how to schedule and take your insurance licensing exam.</p> <p><b>Getting an Insurance License</b></p> <p>Licensing is the way governments ensure that only qualified individuals are allowed to practice certain important professions, such as being an insurance producer. Because insurance is regulated primarily at the state level, the rules for getting an insurance license vary somewhat from state to state.</p> <p>Every state requires individuals to pass a qualification exam to get an insurance license. In addition, most states require individuals to meet a "pre-licensing education requirement" before they can take the qualification exam. In some states, the pre-licensing education requirement can be met through an approved self-study course&#x2014;that is, you buy a book that has been approved in advance by the state insurance department and take an exam (not to be confused with the licensing qualification exam) that you send in to be graded. In other states, the pre-licensing education requirement can only be met by attending an approved classroom course.</p> <blockquote> <p> <b>Note -</b> This Exam Cram text is not approved to meet the pre-licensing education requirement in any specific state. It is designed only as a supplementary aid to help you pass the state insurance licensing exam.</p> </blockquote> <p>Besides fulfilling any pre-licensing education requirement and passing the licensing exam, insurance license candidates must also submit a license application to their state insurance department and have it approved. In some states, the license application must be submitted before taking the license qualification exam; in some states, it must be submitted after passing the exam. Call your state insurance department's licensing division or visit its website to find out what you need to do in your state.</p> <p><b>Taking a Licensing Exam</b></p> <p>As with other aspects of insurance licensing, specific instructions on how to register for your qualification exam are available from the insurance department. Ask for a licensing information bulletin or a licensing candidate handbook, which will describe where and when exams are given, the fees you must pay, and the testing procedures.</p> <p>One thing all state insurance qualification exams have in common is that they are "closed book" exams. You will not be allowed to take any study materials or notes into the testing room. Even phones and calculators may not be allowed. In some states, the only items exam candidates are permitted to take into the testing room are their wallet and keys.</p> <p>In most states, insurance qualification exams are given on computers. However, you will not need any computer or typing skills to take the exam. You will be instructed how to answer questions and given a short practice test to get comfortable with the equipment before the actual qualification exam begins.</p> <p>When you complete a computer-administered exam, the software tells you immediately whether you've passed or failed. Your states will have rules for retesting in the event you don't pass. Those rules are described in your licensing information bulletin/candidate handbook.</p> <p><b>How to Prepare for an Exam</b></p> <p>Whether or not your state has a pre-licensing education requirement, you'll want to study in preparation for the license qualification exam. And even if your state has a pre-licensing education requirement, you'll probably want to do some additional studying to make sure that you are fully prepared for the exam. Your options for additional study include the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Self-study courses:</b> Publishers such as BISYS Education Services offer courses designed to allow you to study on your own for the licensing qualification exam. BISYS license training packages are available in either web-based or print-based formats and contain a number of components:</p> </li> <ul> <li> <p>A <i>Property-Casualty Concepts</i> text that covers all the non&#x2013;state-specific topics on the licensing exam</p> </li> <li> <p>Practice exams that help you evaluate your comprehension of the material in the <i>Concepts</i> text</p> </li> <li> <p>Explanations to answers on the practice exams so that you'll know why each of your responses was right or wrong</p> </li> <li> <p>A state insurance law digest that covers all the state-specific topics on the licensing exam</p> </li> <li> <p>An optional audio CD review program that reviews the key information contained in the <i>Concepts</i> text</p> </li> <li> <p>An optional exam simulator that gives you additional question-and-answer practice over the material covered in the <i>Concepts</i> text and the state insurance law digest</p> </li> </ul> <li> <p> <b>Classroom training:</b> Many colleges and commercial training companies offer classroom training for insurance license exams. Although classroom training generally costs considerably more than self-study, some individuals find that they learn best in a classroom situation. And of course, in many states, the pre-licensing education requirement must be met with classroom study in any case.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Other sources:</b> There's no shortage of materials available on insurance topics. Appendix B, "Need to Know More" will give you an idea of where we think you should look for further discussion.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In addition, Que Publishing's <i>Exam Cram<b> </b> </i>insurance licensing preparation materials are useful in your quest for insurance knowledge. <i>Exam Cram</i> books provide you with a review of the essential information you need to know to pass the tests. They focus the detailed information in the <i>Concepts</i> texts available from BISYS Education Services. Together, the BISYS Education Services license training packages and the Exam Cram review materials create a powerful exam preparation program.</p> <p>This set of required and recommended materials represents an unparalleled collection of sources and resources for insurance licensing qualification and related topics. Our hope is you'll find that this book belongs in that company.</p> <p><b>What This Book Will Not Do</b></p> <p>This book by itself will <i>not </i>teach<i> </i>you everything you need to know to pass your insurance licensing exam. It does not cover the state-specific topics that appear on the exam, usually dealing with laws that apply only in your particular state. That information, although it represents a small proportion of the entire exam, is critical to passing the exam. State-specific topics are covered in the state insurance law digests available from BISYS Education Services. This book reviews the rest of what you need to know before you take the test, with the fundamental purpose dedicated to reviewing the non&#x2013;state-specific information on the insurance licensing exam.</p> <p><b>What This Book Is Designed to Do</b></p> <p>This book uses a variety of teaching and memorization techniques to analyze the exam-related topics and to provide you with ways to input, index, and retrieve what you'll need to know in order to pass the test.</p> <p>This book is designed to be read as a pointer to the areas of knowledge you will be tested on. In other words, you might want to read the book one time, just to get an insight into how comprehensive your knowledge of insurance is. The book is also designed to be read shortly before you go for the actual test and to give you a distillation of the topics covered by the exam in as few pages as possible. We think that you can use this book to get a sense of the underlying context of any topic in the chapters&#x2014;or to skim read for Exam Alerts, bulleted points, summaries, and topic headings.</p> <p>We've drawn on material from each state's exam outlines and from other preparation guides, in particular, BISYS Education Services' <i>Property-Casualty Concepts</i> text. Our aim is to walk you through the knowledge you will need&#x2014;looking over your shoulder, so to speak&#x2014;and point out those things that are important for the exam (Exam Alerts, practice questions, and so on).</p> <p>We've tried to demystify insurance jargon, acronyms, terms, and concepts. Also, wherever we think you're likely to blur past an important concept, we've defined the assumptions and premises behind that concept.</p> <p><b>About This Book</b></p> <p>We've structured the topics in this book to build upon one another. Therefore, the topics covered in later chapters might refer to previous discussions in earlier chapters. We suggest that you read this book from front to back.</p> <p>After you read the book, you can brush up on a certain area by using the Index or the Table of Contents to go straight to the topics and questions you want to reexamine. We've tried to use the headings and subheadings to provide outline information about each given topic. After you've passed the exam and obtained your insurance license, we think that you'll find this book useful as a tightly focused reference and an essential foundation of insurance information.</p> <p><b>Chapter Formats</b></p> <p>Each <i>Exam Cram</i> chapter follows a standard structure, along with graphical cues about especially important or useful material. The structure of a typical chapter is as follows:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Opening hotlists:</b> Each chapter begins with lists of the terms you'll need to understand and the concepts you'll need to master before you can be fully conversant with the chapter's subject matter.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Topical coverage:</b> After the opening hotlists, each chapter covers the topics related to the chapter's subject.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Alerts:</b> Throughout the topical coverage section, we highlight material most likely to appear on the exam by using a special Exam Alert layout that looks like this:</p> </li> <blockquote> <p> <b>Caution -</b> This is what an Exam Alert looks like. An Exam Alert stresses concepts or terms that will most likely appear in one or more license exam questions. For that reason, we think any information found offset in Exam Alert format is worthy of unusual attentiveness on your part.</p> </blockquote> <p> Even if material isn't flagged as an Exam Alert, <i>all</i> the content in this book is associated in some way with test-related material. What appears in the chapter content is critical knowledge.</p> <li> <p> <b>Notes:</b> This book is an overall examination of entry-level insurance knowledge. As such, we'll touch on many aspects of insurance that open doors for further inquiry. Where a topic goes deeper than the scope of the book, we use notes to indicate areas of concern or further training.</p> </li> <blockquote> <p> <b>Note -</b> Cramming for an exam will get you through a test, but it won't make you a fully competent insurance professional. Although you can memorize just the facts you need in order to become licensed, your daily work in the field will rapidly put you in water over your head if you don't continue your insurance education.</p> </blockquote> <li> <p> <b>Review questions:</b> At the end of each chapter is a short list of test questions related to that chapter's topic. Each question has a following explanation of both correct and incorrect answers. The practice questions highlight the areas we found to be most important on the exam.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Need to Know More:</b> On the CD-ROM is an appendix titled "Need To Know More." This appendix provides pointers to resources that we found to be helpful in offering further details on the book's subject matt...</p></li></ul></p><h2>The Master and Margarita (Pocket Penguins)</h2><p>&#39;Manuscripts don&#39;t burn&#39; This ribald, carnivalesque satire - featuring the Devil, true love and a gun-toting cat - was written in the darkest days of the Soviet Union and became an underground sensation. A new series of twenty distinctive, unforgettable Penguin Classics in a beautiful new design and pocket-sized format, with coloured jackets echoing Penguin&#39;s original covers.</p><p>Mikhail Bulgakov was born in Kiev in May 1891. His sympathetic portrayal of White characters in his stories, in the plays The Days of the Turbins (The White Guard), which enjoyed great success at the Moscow Arts Theatre in 1926, and Flight (1927), and his satirical treatment of the officials of the New Economic Plan, led to growing criticism, which became violent after the play The Purple Island. He also wrote a brilliant biography of his literary hero, Jean-Baptiste Moli�re, but The Master and Margarita is generally considered his masterpiece. Fame, at home and abroad, was not to come until a quarter of a century after his death at Moscow in 1940.&#x201c;One of the truly great Russian novels of [the twentieth] century.&#x201d; &#x2014;NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW&#x201c;The book is by turns hilarious, mysterious, contemplative, and poignant . . . A great work.&#x201d;&#x2014;CHICAGO TRIBUNE&#x201c;Bulgakov&#x2019;s The Master and Margarita is a soaring, dazzling novel; an extraordinary fusion of wildly disparate elements. It is a concerto played simultaneously on the organ, the bagpipes, and a pennywhistle, while someone sets off fireworks between the players&#x2019; feet.&#x201d;&#x2014;NEW YORK TIMES&#x201c;Fine, funny, imaginative . . . The Master and Margarita stands squarely in the great Gogolesque tradition of satiric narrative.&#x201d;&#x2014;NEWSWEEK &#x201c;A wild surrealistic romp . . . Brilliantly flamboyant and outrageous.&#x201d;&#x2014;Joyce Carol Oates&#x201c;Sparkling, enchanting, funny, deeply serious and sometimes baffling . . . [The Master and Margarita is] a liberating, exuberant social and political satire combined with a profound moral and political allegory . . . A bravura performance of truly heroic virtuosity, a carnival of the imagination.&#x201d; &#x2014;from the Introduction by Simon Franklin</p><h2>Numerical Methods for Engineers, Sixth Edition</h2><p>Instructors love <i>Numerical Methods for Engineers</i> because it makes teaching easy! Students love it because it is written for them--with clear explanations and examples throughout. The text features a broad array of applications that span all engineering disciplines. <p> The sixth edition retains the successful instructional techniques of earlier editions. Chapra and Canale's unique approach opens each part of the text with sections called Motivation, Mathematical Background, and Orientation. This prepares the student for upcoming problems in a motivating and engaging manner. Each part closes with an Epilogue containing Trade-Offs, Important Relationships and Formulas, and Advanced Methods and Additional References. Much more than a summary, the Epilogue deepens understanding of what has been learned and provides a peek into more advanced methods. Helpful separate Appendices. "Getting Started with MATLAB" abd "Getting Started with Mathcad" which make excellent references. </p><p> Numerous new or revised problems drawn from actual engineering practice, many of which are based on exciting new areas such as bioengineering. The expanded breadth of engineering disciplines covered is especially evident in the problems, which now cover such areas as biotechnology and biomedical engineering. Excellent new examples and case studies span asll areas of engineering disciplines; the students using this text will be able to apply their new skills to their chosen field. </p><p> Users will find use of software packages, specifically MATLAB�, Excel� with VBA and Mathcad�. This includes material on developing MATLAB� m-files and VBA macros.</p></p><p>Steven C.

This deluxe leatherbound gift edition contains not only the full text of Bulfinch&#39;s definitive works, but also dozens of color illustrations and paintings.</p><p>Thomas Bulfinch (1796-1867) was a Massachusetts-based writer and banker who wrote and collected the first popular English-language retellings of Greek, Roman, Eastern, Scandinavian, Arthurian, and medieval myths.<p><b>From Charles Martin's Introduction to <i>Bulfinch's Mythology</i></b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In his Preface, Bulfinch firmly sets his work within the emerging American genre of self-improvement: Other kinds of knowledge may &#x201c;enlarge our possessions or . . . raise our station in society,&#x201d; and there are, of course, books that will tell us how to get rich quickly and how to behave when we have amassed our pile. But, perhaps because he had seen how fortunes may disappear overnight, never to be recovered, Bulfinch puts his faith in the kind of knowledge that can make us &#x201c;happier and better.&#x201d; This knowledge is the knowledge of literature, but we cannot understand the literature of our time without first understanding the mythology that literature so often alludes to. </p><p>How is this knowledge to be attained? Bulfinch is very certain about his audience. It does not consist of members of his own class, the privileged few who have had the benefits of a classical education and would have acquired such knowledge already or at least have the leisure and the means to acquire it. His audience has never gone with Homer to Troy; the Trojan War is new to them; and they want to know how the story comes out in the end: &#x201c;Our readers will be anxious to know the fate of Helen, the fair but guilty occasion of so much slaughter.&#x201d; As Bulfinch must have known, Helen is the creation of the poets who wrote about her, and different poets provided her with different fates. Americans love happy endings, so Bulfinch sees her reconciled at last with the husband she abandoned. </p><p>Bulfinch&#x2019;s audience consists of those with whom he had come in contact during his long and unsuccessful career as a merchant, the self-made men and their wives, who do not want to have to choke down &#x201c;only the dry facts without any of the charm of the original narrative.&#x201d; They want the poetry, too, and they don&#x2019;t have a whole lot of time to spend on getting it. </p><p>They want to be sure that this knowledge may be let into the parlors of their homes without creating any sort of offense &#x201c;to pure taste and good morals.&#x201d; Here a word must be said about Bulfinch&#x2019;s prudery: His subservience to his society&#x2019;s desire to pass over these offenses in silence resulted in a number of significant omissions. It is hard to see how it could be otherwise: The proper Bostonian of Bulfinch&#x2019;s day, referring to a bull as Mr. Cow, would scarcely have known what to make of Queen Phaedra&#x2019;s passion for the prize bull in her husband&#x2019;s herd. </p><p>Bulfinch&#x2019;s readers also want the assurance that this knowledge, so different from their daily experience, is worth having: &#x201c;To devote study to a species of learning which relates wholly to false marvels and obsolete faiths is not to be expected of the general reader in a practical age like this. The time even of the young is claimed by so many sciences of facts and things that little can be set for spare treatises on a science of mere fancy.&#x201d; It is not only the time but the energy as well. Bulfinch can sympathize with the tired businessman at the end of his long day in the office: &#x201c;Thus we hope to teach mythology not as a study, but as a relaxation from study.&#x201d;</p><p>This knowledge, easily acquired and promoting not only happiness but virtue as well, will allow the less privileged members of a restlessly mobile society access to the kind of lore that is the patrimony of the privileged. It is not, Bulfinch states explicitly, &#x201c;for the learned, nor for the theologian, nor for the philosopher, but for the reader of English literature, of either sex, who wishes to comprehend the allusions so frequently made by public speakers, lecturers, essayists, and poets, and those which occur in polite conversation.&#x201d; It is a little bit easier than it ought to be to mock Bulfinch&#x2019;s tone here, but we would be seriously underestimating Bulfinch if we were to regard him as an elitist: His sentiments are as unabashed in their democratic impulse as those of Walt Whitman, in his preface to Leaves of Grass. Bulfinch wishes everyone to have access to the cultural tokens heretofore the possession of the few.</p></p><h2>Planting Noah&#39;s Garden: Further Adventures in Backyard Ecology</h2><p>The ecology-minded author of Noah&#39;s Garden offers a guide to transforming suburban backyards into attractive gardens using the area&#39;s common native flora, along with advice on killing weeds, collecting wild seeds, and much more.</p><p>In <i>Noah's Garden</i>, published in 1994, gardener and writer Sara Stein addressed the business of making a messy backyard--of restoring a naturally chaotic and dynamic "floral-faunal-microbial system" in the place of neatly tended, carefully selected and weeded, and ultimately artificial gardens. Just as charmingly written as its predecessor, <i>Planting Noah's Garden</i> furthers Stein's campaign to make lawns animated, full of disorder, life, and wildness. Studded with ringing tributes to alumroot, trillium, goldenrod, bellworts, and mayflowers, this is a lovely gardener's manifesto. Packed with practical instructions for planning and maintaining a garden of one's own, it's also wonderful entertainment for anyone with a green thumb.Sara Stein is the author of many books, including My Weeds, The Evolution Book, The Science Book, and, of course, Noah&#39;s Garden.

It explains how to choose the best hardware, install jambs, and hang a wide variety of doors. Covers installations from a grand front entrance to a bi-fold closet door.</p><p>For the inexperienced, a casual walk through a building-supply store will yield doors of amazing variety, most ready to mount, some already in prebuilt frames. It might seem simple enough to buy one, bring it home, and install it. Yet most new, perfectly dimensioned doors need to be fitted into openings that are far from being perfectly straight or plumb, and therein lies a problem that any budding or experienced carpenter will encounter repeatedly. Hanging a door is no small feat: it can be much like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole, requires care and skill to be done properly, and can be a major puzzlement indeed to someone new to the process. Katz takes the process from beginning to end, choosing interior and exterior doors, proper hardware and jambs for installation, and installing specialty doors, like arched and French doors, Dutch doors, pocket doors, and many more. He shows how to use jigs and templates to speed up many tasks, and includes a large section on the essentials of weather stripping. Well illustrated and thoroughly diagrammed, this is a book that should be read by every carpenter and do-it-yourselfer who wants to produce professional results and avoid the many pitfalls and common mistakes in hanging doors of any kind. <i>--Mark A.

Auden, and Walter Benjamin, background and contextual material, and a new Introduction from Corngold himself.</p><p><b>Stanley Corngold</b> is a professor emeritus of German and comparative literature at Princeton. He has published widely on modern German writers and thinkers (Nietzsche, Musil, Kraus, Mann, Benjamin, Adorno, among others), but for the most part he has been translating and writing on the work of Franz Kafka. In 2011 he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences.CHAPTER 1<br>When Gregor Samsa woke up one morning from unsettling dreams, he found himself changed in his bed into a monstrous vermin. He was lying on his back as hard as armor plate, and when he lifted his head a little, he saw his vaulted brown belly, sectioned by arch-shaped ribs, to whose dome the cover, about to slide off completely, could barely cling. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, were waving helplessly before his eyes.<br><br>"What's happened to me?" he thought. It was no dream. His room, a regular human room, only a little on the small side, lay quiet between the four familiar walls. Over the table, on which an unpacked line of fabric samples was all spread out--Samsa was a traveling salesman--hung the picture which he had recently cut out of a glossy magazine and lodged in a pretty gilt frame. It showed a lady done up in a fur hat and a fur boa, sitting upright and raising up against the viewer a heavy fur muff in which her whole forearm had disappeared.<br><br>Gregor's eyes then turned to the window, and the overcast weather--he could hear raindrops hitting against the metal window ledge--completely depressed him. "How about going back to sleep for a few minutes and forgetting all this nonsense," he thought, but that was completely impracticable, since he was used to sleeping on his right side and in his present state could not get into that position. No matter how hard he threw himself onto his right side, he always rocked onto his back again. He must have tried it a hundred times, closing his eyes so as not to have to see his squirming legs, and stopped only when he began to feel a slight, dull pain in his side, which he had never felt before.<br><br>"Oh God," he thought, "what a grueling job I've picked! Day in, day out--on the road. The upset of doing business is much worse than the actual business in the home office, and, besides, I've got the torture of traveling, worrying about changing trains, eating miserable food at all hours, constantly seeing new faces, no relationships that last or get more intimate. To the devil with it all!" He felt a slight itching up on top of his belly; shoved himself slowly on his back closer to the bedpost, so as to be able to lift his head better; found the itchy spot, studded with small white dots which he had no idea what to make of; and wanted to touch the spot with one of his legs but immediately pulled it back, for the contact sent a cold shiver through him.<br><br>He slid back again into his original position. "This getting up so early," he thought, "makes anyone a complete idiot. Human beings have to have their sleep. Other traveling salesmen live like harem women. For instance, when I go back to the hotel before lunch to write up the business I've done, these gentlemen are just having breakfast. That's all I'd have to try with my boss; I'd be fired on the spot. Anyway, who knows if that wouldn't be a very good thing for me. If I didn't hold back for my parents' sake, I would have quit long ago, I would have marched up to the boss and spoken my piece from the bottom of my heart. He would have fallen off the desk! It is funny, too, the way he sits on the desk and talks down from the heights to the employees, especially when they have to come right up close on account of the boss's being hard of hearing. Well, I haven't given up hope completely; once I've gotten the money together to pay off my parents' debt to him--that will probably take another five or six years--I'm going to do it without fail. Then I'm going to make the big break. But for the time being I'd better get up, since my train leaves at five."<br><br>And he looked over at the alarm clock, which was ticking on the chest of drawers. "God Almighty!" he thought. It was six-thirty, the hands were quietly moving forward, it was actually past the half-hour, it was already nearly a quarter to. Could it be that the alarm hadn't gone off? You could see from the bed that it was set correctly for four o'clock; it certainly had gone off, too. Yes, but was it possible to sleep quietly through a ringing that made the furniture shake? Well, he certainly hadn't slept quietly, but probably all the more soundly for that. But what should he do now? The next train left at seven o'clock; to make it, he would have to hurry like a madman, and the line of samples wasn't packed yet, and he himself didn't feel especially fresh and ready to march around. And even if he did make the train, he could not avoid getting it from the boss, because the messenger boy had been waiting at the five-o'clock train and would have long ago reported his not showing up. He was a tool of the boss, without brains or backbone. What if he were to say he was sick? But that would be extremely embarrassing and suspicious because during his five years with the firm Gregor had not been sick even once. The boss would be sure to come with the health-insurance doctor, blame his parents for their lazy son, and cut off all excuses by quoting the health-insurance doctor, for whom the world consisted of people who were completely healthy but afraid to work. And, besides, in this case would he be so very wrong? In fact, Gregor felt fine, with the exception of his drowsiness, which was really unnecessary after sleeping so late, and he even had a ravenous appetite.<br><br>Just as he was thinking all this over at top speed, without being able to decide to get out of bed--the alarm clock had just struck a quarter to seven--he heard a cautious knocking at the door next to the head of his bed. "Gregor," someone called--it was his mother--"it's a quarter to seven. Didn't you want to catch the train?" What a soft voice! Gregor was shocked to hear his own voice answering, unmistakably his own voice, true, but in which, as if from below, an insistent distressed chirping intruded, which left the clarity of his words intact only for a moment really, before so badly garbling them as they carried that no one could be sure if he had heard right. Gregor had wanted to answer in detail and to explain everything, but, given the circumstances, confined himself to saying, "Yes, yes, thanks, Mother, I'm just getting up." The wooden door must have prevented the change in Gregor's voice from being noticed outside, because his mother was satisfied with this explanation and shuffled off. But their little exchange had made the rest of the family aware that, contrary to expectations, Gregor was still in the house, and already his father was knocking on one of the side doors, feebly but with his fist. "Gregor, Gregor," he called, "what's going on?" And after a little while he called again in a deeper, warning voice, "Gregor! Gregor!" At the other side door, however, his sister moaned gently, "Gregor? Is something the matter with you? Do you want anything?" Toward both sides Gregor answered: "I'm all ready," and made an effort, by meticulous pronunciation and by inserting long pauses between individual words, to eliminate everything from his voice that might betray him. His father went back to his breakfast, but his sister whispered, "Gregor, open up, I'm pleading with you." But Gregor had absolutely no intention of opening the door and complimented himself instead on the precaution he had adopted from his business trips, of locking all the doors during the night even at home.<br><br>First of all he wanted to get up quietly, without any excitement; get dressed; and, the main thing, have breakfast, and only then think about what to do next, for he saw clearly that in bed he would never think things through to a rational conclusion. He remembered how even in the past he had often felt some kind of slight pain, possibly caused by lying in an uncomfortable position, which, when he got up, turned out to be purely imaginary, and he was eager to see how today's fantasy would gradually fade away. That the change in his voice was nothing more than the first sign of a bad cold, an occupational ailment of the traveling salesman, he had no doubt in the least.<br><br>It was very easy to throw off the cover; all he had to do was puff himself up a little, and it fell off by itself. But after this, things got difficult, especially since he was so unusually broad. He would have needed hands and arms to lift himself up, but instead of that he had only his numerous little legs, which were in every different kind of perpetual motion and which, besides, he could not control. If he wanted to bend one, the first thing that happened was that it stretched itself out;* and if he finally succeeded in getting this leg to do what he wanted, all the others in the meantime, as if set free, began to work in the most intensely painful agitation. "Just don't stay in bed being useless," Gregor said to himself.<br><br>First he tried to get out of bed with the lower part of his body, but this lower part--which by the way he had not seen yet and which he could not form a clear picture of--proved too difficult to budge; it was taking so long; and when finally, almost out of his mind, he lunged forward with all his force, without caring, he had picked the wrong direction and slammed himself violently against the lower bedpost, and the searing pain he felt taught him that exactly the lower part of his body was, for the moment anyway, the most sensitive.<br><br>He therefore tried to get the upper part of his body out of bed first and warily turned his head toward the edge of the bed. This worked easily, and in spite of its width and weight, the mass of his body finally followed, slowly, the movement of his head. But when at last he stuck his head over the edge of the bed into the air, he got too scared to continue any further, since if he finally let himself fall in this position, it would be a miracle if he didn't injure his head. And just now he had better not for the life of him lose consciousness; he would rather stay in bed.<br><br>But when, once again, after the same exertion, he lay in his original position, sighing, and again watched his little legs struggling, if possible more fiercely, with each other and saw no way of bringing peace and order into this mindless motion, he again told himself that it was impossible for him to stay in bed and that the most rational thing was to make any sacrifice for even the smallest hope of freeing himself from the bed. But at the same time he did not forget to remind himself occasionally that thinking things over calmly--indeed, as calmly as possible--was much better than jumping to desperate decisions. At such moments he fixed his eyes as sharply as possible on the window, but unfortunately there was little confidence and cheer to be gotten from the view of the morning fog, which shrouded even the other side of the narrow street. "Seven o'clock already," he said to himself as the alarm clock struck again, "seven o'clock already and still such a fog." And for a little while he lay quietly, breathing shallowly, as if expecting, perhaps, from the complete silence the return of things to the way they really and naturally were.<br><br>But then he said to himself, "Before it strikes a quarter past seven, I must be completely out of bed without fail. Anyway, by that time someone from the firm will be here to find out where I am, since the office opens before seven." And now he started rocking the complete length of his body out of the bed with a smooth rhythm. If he let himself topple out of bed in this way, his head, which on falling he planned to lift up sharply, would presumably remain unharmed. His back seemed to be hard; nothing was likely to happen to it when it fell onto the carpet. His biggest misgiving came from his concern about the loud crash that was bound to occur and would probably create, if not terror, at least anxiety behind all the doors. But that would have to be risked.<br><br>When Gregor's body already projected halfway out of bed--the new method was more of a game than a struggle, he only had to keep on rocking and jerking himself along--he thought how simple everything would be if he could get some help. Two strong persons--he thought of his father and the maid--would have been completely sufficient; they would only have had to shove their arms under his arched back, in this way scoop him off the bed, bend down with their burden, and then just be careful and patient while he managed to swing himself down onto the floor, where his little legs would hopefully acquire some purpose. Well, leaving out the fact that the doors were locked, should he really call for help? In spite of all his miseries, he could not repress a smile at this thought.<br><br>He was already so far along that when he rocked more strongly he could hardly keep his balance, and very soon he would have to commit himself, because in five minutes it would be a quarter past seven--when the doorbell rang. "It's someone from the firm," he said to himself and almost froze, while his little legs only danced more quickly. For a moment everything remained quiet. "They're not going to answer," Gregor said to himself, captivated by some senseless hope. But then, of course, the maid went to the door as usual with her firm stride and opened up. Gregor only had to hear the visitor's first word of greeting to know who it was--the office manager himself. Why was only Gregor condemned to work for a firm where at the slightest omission they immediately suspected the worst? Were all employees louts without exception, wasn't there a single loyal, dedicated worker among them who, when he had not fully utilized a few hours of the morning for the firm, was driven half-mad by pangs of conscience and was actually unable to get out of bed? Really, wouldn't it have been enough to send one of the apprentices to find out--if this prying were absolutely necessary--did the manager himself have to come, and did the whole innocent family have to be shown in this way that the investigation of this suspicious affair could be entrusted only to the intellect of the manager? And more as a result of the excitement produced in Gregor by these thoughts than as a result of any real decision, he swung himself out of bed with all his might. There was a loud thump, but it was not a real crash. The fall was broken a little by the carpet, and Gregor's back was more elastic than he had thought, which explained the not very noticeable muffled sound. Only he had not held his head carefully enough and hit it; he turned it and rubbed it on the carpet in anger and pain.</p><h2>The Qur&#39;an (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>One of the most influential books in the history of literature, recognized as the greatest literary masterpiece in Arabic, the <em>Qur'an</em> is the supreme authority and living source of all Islamic teaching, the sacred text that sets out the creed, rituals, ethics, and laws of Islam. Yet despite the growing interest in Islamic teachings and culture, there has never been a truly satisfactory English translation of the <em>Qur'an</em>, until now. <br> This superb new translation of the <em>Qur'an</em> is written in contemporary language that remains faithful to the meaning and spirit of the original, making the text crystal clear while retaining all of this great work's eloquence. The translation is accurate and completely free from the archaisms, incoherence, and alien structures that mar existing translations. Thus, for the first time, English-speaking readers will have a text of the <em>Qur'an</em> which is easy to use and comprehensible. Furthermore, Haleem includes notes that explain geographical, historical, and personal allusions as well as an index in which Qur'anic material is arranged into topics for easy reference. His introduction traces the history of the Qur'an, examines its structure and stylistic features, and considers issues related to militancy, intolerance, and the subjection of women. <br> Clearly written and filled with helpful information and guidance, this brilliant translation of the <em>Qur'an</em> is the best available introduction to the faith of Moslems around the world.</p><p><br><strong>Muhammad Abdel Haleem</strong> was born in Egypt, and learned the <em>Qur'an</em> by heart from childhood. He is Professor of Arabic and Islamic Studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London. He is the Editor of the <em>Journal of Qur'anic Studies</em>.<br><br>"Haleem has managed to transform the complex grammar and structure of the holy book into a form of modern English which reads easily and flows smoothly without taking liberties with the inviolable text. This turns the <em>Qur'an</em> into a book which allows English-speakers to peer further into the heart of Islam, from its basic precepts on, say, fasting, to its view of the after-life. This is crucial, not just for the growing majority of Muslims who do not speak Arabic as a first language, but for non-Muslims who are curious about this controversial religion.... Given the tension between Islam and the West, that is a blessing."--<em>The Economist</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Early Literacy in Preschool and Kindergarten (3rd Edition)</h2><p><p> <i>Early Literacy in Preschool and Kindergarten: A Multicultural Perspective</i> is an applied book focusing on how literacy develops in young children and the ways in which teachers can encourage the natural emergence of early reading and writing.

While most early literacy texts treat preschool learning in a chapter or two, this entire text focuses on early literacy in the preschool, leading up to what is expected in kindergarten. <i>Early Literacy in Preschool and Kindergarten</i> presents a unique approach to exploring literacy with preschool and kindergarten children. The current recognition that learning to read and write can emerge naturally in young children when supported by appropriate teaching methods and materials has led the authors to develop a fresh approach by using classroom learning centers, children's literature, and "cultural characters" to involve children in their own learning. </p> <p> We now know that literacy begins at birth. Right from the start infants try to communicate with those around them through crying and cooing, smiling, and babbling. As toddlers, they pay close attention to their caregivers, striving to imitate the sounds they hear. By the time they are preschoolers, ages 3 through 5, young children are fully engaged in emerging into early literacy: listening, speaking, and exploring their own experimental reading and writing. By kindergarten, they are ready for more formal instruction in reading and writing while continuing their own natural emergence. </p> <p> To support such development, this text presents ideas to involve teachers, student teachers, and their children in a unique "cultural character early literacy method" that uses children's picture books as lead-ins to activities for engaging children in speaking, listening, writing, and reading. These books introduce children to the multicultural world around them in a meaningful way through cultural book characters children can identify with&#x2014;such as Suki, the Asian American girl who worries about whether her mother will remember to pick her up at the day care center in <i>Will You Come Back for Me?;</i> the Caribbean boy in <i>Hue Boy</i> who tries desperately to grow taller but can't seem to do it until his father returns; or the Anglo girl Anna and her Navajo friend Juanita, who build the biggest bridge in preschool when they finally put their blocks together in <i>Building a Bridge.</i> </p> <p> Teachers and student teachers learn to use puppets, dolls, character cutouts, chopsticks, unit blocks, drums, painting and weaving, tape recorders, computers, role plays, flannelboards, and story reenactments to bring these book characters to life. Children take it from there, converting their adventures with these multicultural characters into accomplishments in speaking and listening, mock writing, book making, and storytelling, to name a few. </p> <p> The text is divided into four parts: Part 1, "Getting Started with Early Literacy," which defines the cultural character approach and helps teachers choose picture books with exciting cultural characters that can lead children into literacy activities; part 2, "Emergent Speaking," with chapters on the foundations of early literacy, music as a natural language, and speaking and listening in prescho9l; part 3, "Emergent Writing," with chapters on developing eye-hand coordination, art as a natural language, and becoming a writer; and part 4, "Emergent Reading;" with chapters on how reading emerges, the home book experience, and becoming a reader in kindergarten. A topical book index from Acceptance and Adoption to Worry and Writing helps readers choose from among the 200 books described in this text. Making plans for children with curriculum webs and using accomplishment cards to evaluate individual gains give teachers powerful new tools to integrate cultural education into every curriculum area. </p> <p> Both teachers and student teachers can implement this approach with ease using helpful checklists such as <i>"Choosing Cultural Character Picture Books," "Learning Center Checklist," "Spoken Language Checklist," "Eye-Hand Coordination Checklist," "Preschool Writing Behaviors Checklist," "Preschool Reading Behaviors Checklist,"</i> and <i>"Choosing Predictable Cultural Character Books."</i> In total 93 engaging cultural characters from 24 different cultures shown in 200 current picture books are presented. Acquiring the books is made easy through the bookstores, publishers, and Web sites listed or inexpensively with the 60 paperback books listed from Scholastic in appendix A. </p> <p> Much of the information in this text has never before appeared in print, including many of the ideas for using cultural characters to lead children into literacy activities, as well as the in-depth survey of types of reading instruction used in kindergartens across the country. The information presented has been carefully researched. The photographs of children using cultural characters in literacy activities should stimulate even more original ideas by readers. Altogether <i>Early Literacy in Preschool and Kindergarten</i> should help teachers and student teachers to solve the problems of "What kinds of reading and writing activities are really appropriate for such young children?" and "How do I go about implementing them successfully?" </p></p><h2>Lysistrata (Bryn Mawr Commentaries, Greek) (Ancient Greek and English Edition)</h2><p>For New condition books; You will be the first to open the book cover.

Another chapter traces the fate of 65 shipwrecked Australian nurses and British soldiers who were shot or stabbed to death by Japanese soldiers. Thirty-two other nurses, who landed on another island, were captured and sent to Sumatra to become comfort women&#x201d; prostitutes for Japanese soldiers. Tanaka recounts how thousands of Australian and British POWs died in the infamous Sandakan camp in the Borneo jungle in 1945. Those who survived were forced to endure a tortuous 160-mile march on which anyone who dropped out of line was immediately shot. Only six escapees lived to tell the tale.Based on exhaustive research in previously closed archives, this book represents a landmark analysis of Japanese war crimes. The author explores individual atrocities in their broader social, psychological, and institutional milieu and places Japanese behavior during the war in the broader context of the dehumanization of men at war without denying individual and national responsibility.</p><p><b>Yuki Tanaka</b> is a Visiting Research Fellow at the Australian National University.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Japanese</p><h2>Shakti Rising: Embracing Shadow and Light on the Goddess Path to Wholeness</h2><p><p><b>Winner of the 2017 Nautilus Gold Book Award!</b><br><br> The wisdom of the Mahavidyas, the ten wisdom goddesses who represent the interconnected darkness and light within all of us, has been steeped in esoteric and mystical descriptions that made them seem irrelevant to ordinary life. But with this book, written by a respected cardiologist who found herself on a spiritual search for the highest truth, you&#x2019;re invited to explore this ancient knowledge and learn how it can be applied to daily struggles and triumphs&#x2014;and how it can help you find unreserved self-love and acceptance.</p><p>The pursuit of contentment is an innate part of the human experience, arising from a fundamental sense of lack or inadequacy&#x2014;all the things we believe to be wrong with us when we compare or judge ourselves. In our search for peace and happiness, we may find ourselves fighting the shadows within us, trying to repress or disown certain qualities, especially our anger, violence, discomfort, craving, and disappointment. But in order to stop this fight, we must expand our understanding beyond the dualities of good versus bad, right versus wrong, and beautiful versus ugly, and accept the parts of ourselves we&#x2019;ve tried to deny.</p><p>Pulling from Eastern traditions including tantra and yoga, and focusing on the feminine principle of divine energy also known as Shakti, this book bridges the divide between dualistic concepts and non-dual philosophy. By exploring the symbolism of the Mahavidyas (Kali, Tara, Tripurasundari, Bhuvaneshwari, Tripura Bhairavi, Chinnamasta, Dhumavati, Baglamukhi, Matangi, and Kamalatmika)&#x2014;each with a veiled face representing a destructive quality that perpetuates ignorance and suffering, and a true face representing the wisdom that stimulates profound transformation and liberation&#x2014;you&#x2019;ll learn to embrace and incorporate every aspect of who you are.</p><p>With practices, self-inquiry prompts, and stories from the author&#x2019;s own spiritual seeking, this exploration of the divine feminine will gently reveal the source of your fear, pain, and suffering, showing you that when you allow those parts of yourself to arise and simply be, you can finally begin to heal, overcome your limitations, and open to the light and beauty of your true nature.</p></p><p><b>Kavitha M.

Kavitha Chinnaiyan underlines the constant cosmic play of the ten goddesses as if they were dancing in our unconscious, to unify and bring out the balance between light and darkness. This guide of self-discovery, based on a profound comprehension of yoga, Advaita, and tantra, is also very practical, and the exercises proposed are efficient.

Through her extensive breadth of knowledge, practice, and experience, Kavitha distills the Mahavidyas in an extremely digestible way for those of us who might fantasize about becoming renunciates, but have unavoidable things like jobs, families, bills, and responsibilities to tend to, to create a useful work we can integrate into daily spiritual practice and inquiry.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<b>Elizabeth DiAlto</b>, author of&nbsp;<i>Untame Yourself</i>, and host of the <i>Untame the Wild Soul</i> podcast<br><br>&#x201c;In <i>Shakti Rising</i>, Kavitha Chinnaiyan presents an in-depth look at the Mahavidyas, ten aspects of the divine mother. Although there are a few books in English out there on this subject, she gives a deeper meaning to each goddess, which has helped me gain more clarity on their aspects. I really liked the practical meditations, creating a deeper and personal connection to the dark and light side of the goddess.

Here, to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of <i>Stoner</i>, NYRB Classics offers a special hardback edition of the book that also includes a previously unpublished correspondence between John Williams and his agent about its writing and publication.</p><p><b>John Williams </b>(1922&#x2013;1994) was born and raised in northeast Texas. Despite a talent for writing and acting, Williams flunked out of a local junior college after his first year. He reluctantly joined the war effort, enlisting in the Army Air Corps, and managed to write a draft of his first novel while there. Once home, Williams found a publisher for the novel and enrolled at the University of Denver, where he was eventually to receive both his B.A. and M.A., and where he was to return as an instructor in 1954.<br><br>He remained on the staff of the creative writing program at the University of Denver until his retirement in 1985. During these years, he was an active guest lecturer and writer, editing an anthology of English Renaissance poetry and publishing two volumes of his own poems, as well as three novels, <i>Butcher&#x2019;s Crossing</i>, <i>Stoner</i>, and the National Book Award&#x2013;winning <i>Augustus</i> (all published as NYRB Classics).<br><br><b>John McGahern</b> (1934-2006) was one of the most acclaimed Irish writers of his generation. His work, including six novels and four collections of short stories, often centered on the Irish predicament, both political and temperamental. <i>Amongst Women</i>, his best-known book, was short-listed for the Booker Prize and made into a popular miniseries. His last book, the memoir <i>All Will Be Well</i>, was published shortly before his death.STONER opens with the declaration that at the time of William Stoner&#39;s death, he had never advanced beyond the rank of assistant professor of English literature and was held in no particular esteem by his colleagues. Few students could even remember him when his name was mentioned. Then John Williams recounts the story of Stoner&#39;s life from the age of 19 to his death, and we find that his life was not ordinary at all. Robin Field fully inhabits Stoner&#39;s character, dragging every morsel of tragedy, inevitability and, occasionally, wiliness and joy from Williams&#39;s understated writing. Field&#39;s performance helps us understand that an ordinary person&#39;s life is still grand, emotional, and worthy. Originally published in 1965 and recently reissued, STONER is a small miracle of a novel that is enhanced by a narrator who is a perfect match. A.B.

Yet for nearly a third of the conflict's entire timespan, Hitler and Stalin stood side by side as partners. The Pact that they agreed had a profound&#x2014;and bloody&#x2014;impact on Europe, and is fundamental to understanding the development and denouement of the war.<br><br>In <i>The Devils' Alliance</i>, acclaimed historian Roger Moorhouse explores the causes and implications of the Nazi-Soviet Pact, an unholy covenant whose creation and dissolution were crucial turning points in World War II. Forged by the German foreign minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, and his Soviet counterpart, Vyacheslav Molotov, the nonaggression treaty briefly united the two powers in a brutally efficient collaboration. Together, the Germans and Soviets quickly conquered and divided central and eastern Europe&#x2014;Poland, the Baltic States, Finland, and Bessarabia&#x2014;and the human cost was staggering: during the two years of the pact hundreds of thousands of people in central and eastern Europe caught between Hitler and Stalin were expropriated, deported, or killed. Fortunately for the Allies, the partnership ultimately soured, resulting in the surprise June 1941 German invasion of the Soviet Union. Ironically, however, the powers' exchange of materiel, blueprints, and technological expertise during the period of the Pact made possible a far more bloody and protracted war than would have otherwise been conceivable.<br><br>Combining comprehensive research with a gripping narrative, <i>The Devils' Alliance</i> is the authoritative history of the Nazi-Soviet Pact&#x2014;and a portrait of the people whose lives were irrevocably altered by Hitler and Stalin's nefarious collaboration.<br><br></p><p><b>Roger Moorhouse</b> studied history at the University of London and is a regular contributor to BBC History Magazine.

Greenstein has long been one of our keenest observers of the modern presidency. In <i>The Presidential Difference</i>, he provides a fascinating and instructive account of the presidential qualities that have served well and poorly in the Oval Office, beginning with Franklin D. Roosevelt's first hundred days. He surveys each president's political skill, vision, cognitive style, organizational capacity, ability to communicate, and emotional intelligence--and argues that the last is the most important in predicting presidential success. Throughout, Greenstein offers a series of bottom-line judgments on each of his thirteen subjects as well as an overarching theory of why presidents succeed or fail.</p><br><p> In this new edition, Greenstein assesses President George W. Bush in the wake of his two terms. The book also includes a new chapter on the leadership style of President Obama and how we can expect it to affect his presidency and legacy.</p></p><p><p>Praise for Princeton's previous editions: "A wonderful book. . . .

This is a significantly expanded edition of one of the greatest works of modern political theory. Sheldon Wolin's <i>Politics and Vision</i> inspired and instructed two generations of political theorists after its appearance in 1960. Substantially expanded for republication in 2004, it is both a sweeping survey of Western political thought and a powerful account of contemporary predicaments of power and democracy. In lucid and compelling prose, Sheldon Wolin offers original, subtle, and often surprising interpretations of political theorists from Plato to Rawls. Situating them historically while sounding their depths, he critically engages their diverse accounts of politics, theory, power, justice, citizenship, and institutions. The new chapters, which show how thinkers have grappled with the immense possibilities and dangers of modern power, are themselves a major theoretical statement. They culminate in Wolin&#x2019;s remarkable argument that the United States has invented a new political form, "inverted totalitarianism,&#x201c; in which economic rather than political power is dangerously dominant. In this expanded edition, the book that helped to define political theory in the late twentieth century should energize, enlighten, and provoke generations of scholars to come.</p><br><p> Wolin originally wrote <i>Politics and Vision</i> to challenge the idea that political analysis should consist simply of the neutral observation of objective reality. He argues that political thinkers must also rely on creative vision. Wolin shows that great theorists have been driven to shape politics to some vision of the Good that lies outside the existing political order. As he tells it, the history of theory is thus, in part, the story of changing assumptions about the Good.</p><br><p> Acclaimed as a tour de force when it was first published, and a major scholarly event when the expanded edition appeared, <i>Politics and Vision</i> will instruct, inspire, and provoke for generations to come.</p></p><p>Winner of the 2005 David and Elaine Spitz Prize, Conference for the Study of Political Thought<p>"<i>Politics and Vision</i> is one of the twentieth century's most important works of political philosophy. Its magisterial sweep of the ideas and philosophical debates that define western civilization illuminates what allows a civic democracy to flourish and what destroys it. Wolin uses the insights of the great philosophical minds of the past, from Plato to Karl Marx, Max Weber and Hannah Arendt, as a lens by which he examines our own failed democracy, a system he describes as "inverted totalitarianism." In the pantheon of contemporary political philosophers Sheldon Wolin stands alone, not only for his brilliance but for his courage."<b>--Chris Hedges, Pulitzer Prize-winner and author of <i>War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning</i></b></p><p>"Sheldon Wolin is our premier contemporary theorist of engaged democracy. This expanded edition of <i>Politics and Vision</i> offers an extraordinarily comprehensive and acute account of the encounter between philosophy and political power, from classical Greece to the postmodern era of Superpower. The new edition demonstrates the power of Wolin's original enterprise by bringing it into constructive relationship with Marx, Nietzsche, and Dewey, and with political philosophy since Rawls. Essential reading for anyone concerned with the possibilities of politics in the twenty-first century."<b>--Josiah Ober, Princeton University, author of <i>The Athenian Revolution</i> and <i>Political Dissent in Democratic Athens</i></b></p><p>"In his classic work, Sheldon Wolin brings to light the most fascinating meanings of politics in its highest sense. He writes with the passion of the citizen who worries about power, and the rigor of the thinker committed to intellectual sharpness and historical awareness. In this new edition, Wolin explores in depth the most difficult challenges that our democratic ocieties are facing after their victory over totalitarianisms. Like the first edition, this new one will open fresh avenues to political thinking, and will teach us new and valuable lessons in the difficult art of being free citizens."<b>--Maurizio Viroli, Princeton University, author of <i>Niccol�'s Smile: A<br>Biography of Machiavelli</i></b></p><p>"I am happy to report that the excitement of the great work represented by the first edition still remains, and that this book is, if anything, enhanced by the addition of the chapters on theorists including Marx, Nietzsche, Popper and Dewey, and Rawls. This revised and expanded edition is more somberly reflective than its predecessor, and at the same time more provocative in the overall picture it presents."<b>--Jeremy Waldron, Columbia Law School, author of <i>God, Locke, and Equality</i></b></p><p>"A great, provocative, intense, brilliant book. Several generations of political theorists were provoked and instructed by the original edition. Here, Sheldon Wolin brings up to date our understanding of politics and shows why earlier understandings are inadequate to contemporary developments."<b>--Tracy B.

The malingering hero, Yossarian, is endlessly inventive in his schemes to save his skin from the horrible chances of war, and his story is studded with incidents and devices (including the Glorious Loyalty Oath Crusade and the hilariously sinister bureaucratic rule that gives the book its title) that propel the narrative in a headlong satiric rush.&nbsp;But the reason <i>Catch-22</i>'s&nbsp;satire never weakens and its jokes never date stems not from the comedy itself but from the savage, unerring, Swiftian indignation out of which that comedy springs. This fractured anti-epic, with all its aggrieved humanity, has given us the most enduring image we have of modern warfare.&nbsp;<br><br>This hardcover Everyman's Library edition includes an introduction by Malcolm Bradbury, a chronology of the author's life and times, and a select bibliography. It is printed on acid-free paper, with sewn bindings, full-cloth covers, foil stamping, and a silk ribbon marker.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></p><p>There was a time when reading Joseph Heller's classic satire on the murderous insanity of war was nothing less than a rite of passage. Echoes of Yossarian, the wise-ass bombardier who was too smart to die but not smart enough to find a way out of his predicament, could be heard throughout the counterculture. As a result, it's impossible not to consider <i>Catch-22</i> to be something of a period piece. But 40 years on, the novel's undiminished strength is its looking-glass logic. Again and again, Heller's characters demonstrate that what is commonly held to be good, is bad; what is sensible, is nonsense. <p> Yossarian says, "You're talking about winning the war, and I am talking about winning the war and keeping alive." <br> "Exactly," Clevinger snapped smugly. "And which do you think is more important?" <br> "To whom?" Yossarian shot back. "It doesn't make a damn bit of difference who wins the war to someone who's dead." <br> "I can't think of another attitude that could be depended upon to give greater comfort to the enemy." <br> "The enemy," retorted Yossarian with weighted precision, "is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which side he's on." <br> Mirabile dictu, the book holds up post-Reagan, post-Gulf War. It's a good thing, too. As long as there's a military, that engine of lethal authority, <i>Catch-22</i> will shine as a handbook for smart-alecky pacifists. It's an utterly serious and sad, but damn funny book.</p><b>Joseph Heller</b>&nbsp;was born in 1923 in Brooklyn, New York. He served as a bombardier in the Second World War and then attended New York University, Columbia, and Oxford University, the last on a Fulbright scholarship. He taught for two years at Pennsylvania State University, before returning to New York, where he began a successful career in the advertising departments of <i>Time, Look, </i>and <i>McCall's </i>magazines.&nbsp;It was during this time that he had the idea for&nbsp;<i>Catch-22</i>. Working on the novel in spare moments and evenings at home, it took him eight years to complete and was first published in 1961. His second novel,&nbsp;<i>Something Happened,</i>&nbsp;was published in 1974,&nbsp;<i>Good As Gold</i>&nbsp;in 1979 and&nbsp;<i>Closing Time</i>&nbsp;in 1994. He is also the author of the play&nbsp;<i>We Bombed in New Haven</i>. Joseph Heller died in 1999.</p><h2>The Jewish Century</h2><p><p>This masterwork of interpretative history begins with a bold declaration: The Modern Age is the Jewish Age--and we are all, to varying degrees, Jews.</p><p>The assertion is, of course, metaphorical. But it underscores Yuri Slezkine's provocative thesis. Not only have Jews adapted better than many other groups to living in the modern world, they have become the premiere symbol and standard of modern life everywhere.</p><p>Slezkine argues that the Jews were, in effect, among the world's first free agents. They traditionally belonged to a social and anthropological category known as "service nomads," an outsider group specializing in the delivery of goods and services. Their role, Slezkine argues, was part of a broader division of human labor between what he calls Mercurians-entrepreneurial minorities--and Apollonians--food-producing majorities.</p><p>Since the dawning of the Modern Age, Mercurians have taken center stage. In fact, Slezkine argues, modernity is all about Apollonians becoming Mercurians--urban, mobile, literate, articulate, intellectually intricate, physically fastidious, and occupationally flexible. Since no group has been more adept at Mercurianism than the Jews, he contends, these exemplary ancients are now model moderns.</p><p>The book concentrates on the drama of the Russian Jews, including �migr�s and their offspring in America, Palestine, and the Soviet Union. But Slezkine has as much to say about the many faces of modernity--nationalism, socialism, capitalism, and liberalism--as he does about Jewry. Marxism and Freudianism, for example, sprang largely from the Jewish predicament, Slezkine notes, and both Soviet Bolshevism and American liberalism were affected in fundamental ways by the Jewish exodus from the Pale of Settlement.</p><p>Rich in its insight, sweeping in its chronology, and fearless in its analysis, this sure-to-be-controversial work is an important contribution not only to Jewish and Russian history but to the history of Europe and America as well.</p></p><p><p>"Yuri Slezkine has written an extraordinary book with continual surprises. A landmark work."<b>--Ronald Suny, University of Chicago</b></p><p>"I can think of few works that match the conceptual range, polemical sharpness, and sheer �lan of <i>The Jewish Century</i>. An extraordinary book: analytically acute, lyrical, witty, and disturbing all at once."<b>--Benjamin Nathans, author of <i>Beyond the Pale: The Jewish Encounter with Late Imperial Russia</i></b></p><p>"Yuri Slezkine's book is at the same time very personal and very erudite. A blend of political and cultural history at its best, it is a splendid work, beautifully written. A true accomplishment by a master historian."<b>--Jan T. Gross, author of <i>Neighbors</i></b></p><p>"Once every few decades, a book forces a reevaluation of basic assumptions in a field. Yuri Slezkine's passionate and brilliant tour de force not only challenges received wisdom about Russian and Soviet Jews, but just as provocatively overturns the uniqueness that many ascribe to Jewish history altogether. <i>The Jewish Century</i> is a work sure to spark heated debate not only about the Jews, but also about what it means to be modern."<b>--David Biale, editor, <i>Cultures of the Jews: A New History</i></b></p><p>"<i>The Jewish Century</i> is an extraordinarily stimulating and ambitious piece of work that invites debate and controversy. Slezkine's account is subtle, beautifully written, and very moving; it combines humor, irony, and understated passion."<b>--Tim McDaniel, author of <i>The Agony of the Russian Idea</i> (Princeton)</b></p><p>"This is a strong, well-documented, passionately argued, original, and bold essay on history, or the ideology of history, in what I called "a Jewish century" (see my Language in <i>Time of Revolution</i>). One wants to argue with the author on many pages of the manuscript, but it is such a powerful, sweeping statement that it must be left whole and intact, as a central position in future arguments on modernity, the twentieth century, and the history of the Jews."<b>--Benjamin Harshav, Yale University</b></p><b>Yuri Slezkine</b> is Professor of History and Director of the Institute of Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies at the University of California, Berkeley.

This revision incorporates the many refinements to the translation of Utopia undertaken for the dual-language scholarly edition published in 1995, and Professor Logan has also updated the editorial commentary and introduction to take account of scholarship published since the first Cambridge Texts edition of Utopia appeared in 1989. This Logan-Adams edition is now firmly established as the most accurate, acc essible and student-friendly rendition of Utopia currently available.First published in Latin in 1516, Thomas More&#39;s Utopia is one of the most influential books in the Western philosophical and literary tradition and one of the supreme achievements of Renaissance humanism. This is the first edition of Utopia since 1965 (the Yale edition) to combine More&#39;s Latin text with an English translation, and also the first edition to provide a Latin text that is at once accurate and readable. The text is based on the early editions (with the Froben edition of March 1518 as copy-text), but spelling and punctuation have been regularised in accordance with modern practices. The translation is a revised version of the acclaimed Adams translation, which also appears in Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought. The edition, which incorporates the results of recent Utopian scholarship, includes an introduction, textual apparatus, a full commentary and a guide to the voluminous scholarly and critical literature on Utopia.</p><h2>The American Journey: A History of the United States: Combined Volume</h2><p>Engages readers by tracing the individual and collective journeys of Americans.

His honors include awards from the National Institute of Arts and Letters and the American Council of Learned Societies. He died in 1984.<br>"The importance of Lattimore's skill and careful work and of his highly-informed literary sense is that you do indeed come away with a new and strong sense of who the reporters are. And when you know that, it expands the meaning of the Story."--Richard Dyer, <i>The Boston Globe</i><br><br>"Without the gaudy beauties of the King James version or the overly hip sound of some modern editions, Lattimore's <i>New Testament </i>possesses an austere, moving plainness, a willingness to shape long sentences, and an admirable clarity."--<i>The Washington Post Book World</i><br><br>"The important news is that Mr. Lattimore has provided a... self-consistent, personal, sanely literal version of the four texts most central to our tragic history. He has avoided the twin shoals of caprice and ego, and his dedication to the line of the originals has produced an air of solidity and reliability often missing from single efforts."--Reynolds Price<br><br>"An impressive, scholarly new version by the eminent translator."--<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br></p><h2>Notre-Dame of Paris (The Hunchback of Notre Dame)</h2><p><b>More commonly known as <i>The Hunchback of Notre-Dame</i>, Victor Hugo's Romantic novel of dark passions and unrequited love</b><br><br> In the vaulted Gothic towers of Notre-Dame Cathedral lives Quasimodo, the hunchbacked bellringer. Mocked and shunned for his appearance, he is pitied only by Esmerelda, a beautiful gypsy dancer to whom he becomes completely devoted. Esmerelda, however, has also attracted the attention of the sinister archdeacon Claude Frollo, and when she rejects his lecherous approaches, Frollo hatches a plot to destroy her, that only Quasimodo can prevent. Victor Hugo's sensational, evocative novel brings life to the medieval Paris he loved, and mourns its passing in one of the greatest historical romances of the nineteenth century. <br><br> John Sturrock's clear, contemporary translation is accompanied by an introduction discussing it as a passionate novel of ideas, written in defence of Gothic architecture and of a burgeoning democracy, and demonstrating that an ugly exterior can conceal moral beauty.

After the opening chapters containing grammar exercises to reinforce basic concepts, students begin reading actual Hebrew text based on the Joseph story from Genesis 37:50. The text has been abridged and modified to present students with a text that they can read with minimal help. The readings are accompanied with three types of annotations: the Hebrew root or lexical form, an English gloss, or grammatical and textual explanations. The notes are provided to facilitate reading comprehension by identifying unfamiliar words and concepts.<br><br>As familiarity with vocabulary and grammar increases, the readings are modified less and less until students are essentially reading the standard Hebrew text used in most Hebrew Bibles today.

This new, sixth, edition has an emphasis on Chinese art history, not as an assemblage of related topics, but as a continuous story. With updated attributions and dating throughout and a revised bibliography, it reflects the latest archaeological discoveries, as well as giving increased attention to modern and contemporary art and to calligraphy throughout China&#x2019;s history, with additional discussions of work by women artists.

Sullivan's approach remains true to the way the Chinese themselves view art, providing readers with a sense of the sweep of history through China's dynasties.

A chapter overview is followed by learning objectives and a discussion of the topics related to those objectives. A brief summary is included in each chapter in addition to discussion questions, suggested activities, case studies, and additional readings. Publishers whose tests are cited in the text are listed in Appendix B, and key terms are defined in the glossary. Separate indexes are provided for authors, topics, and tests. </p> <p> I have avoided evaluative critiques of most of the tests cited. I encourage readers to use the Buros home page (<b>http://www.unl.edu/buros/</b>) to locate the reviews that have been printed in the <i>Mental Measurements Yearbooks, Test Critiques,</i> or professional journals. Selection decisions should be situationally specific rather than generalized; many experts now advocate evaluating the consequential validity of the test. Myriad tests are available in almost all areas. The annotated lists included in the text are not exhaustive, nor do they represent all the exemplary tests in the field. Their purpose is to indicate the range and scope of tests in each area. The text attempts to encourage the reader's curiosity and interest and stimulate further investigation, research, reading, and experimentation to broaden knowledge, skills, and competencies in measurement and evaluation. </p></p><h2>Melodia Complete</h2><p>A Course in Sight-Singing Solfeggio</p><p></p><h2>An Introduction to Literary Chinese: Revised Edition (Harvard East Asian Monographs)</h2><p>This textbook for beginning students contains 35 lessons of increasingly difficulty designed to introduce students to the basic patterns of Classical Chinese and to give them practice in reading a variety of texts. The lessons are structured to encourage students to move beyond reliance on the glossaries provided in the text and to become increasingly familiar with dictionaries and other reference works. The Introduction to the book summarizes the grammar of Literary Chinese. Part I presents eight lessons on parts of speech, verbs, negatives, and the basic sentence structures. Each lesson contains a grammatical overview, a short text with glossary and notes, and practice exercises. Part II consists of sixteen intermediate-level lessons based on increasingly long and complex texts. The advanced-level, Part III, focuses on selections from five important early Chinese authors. Part IV has six lessons based on Tang and Song dynasty prose and poetry. Appendixes provide further discussions of grammatical issues, chronologies and maps, and a glossary of function words.</p><p>Michael A.

Reflecting his infectious enthusiasm for "the best natural history," Beebe's personal assortment of favorites includes excerpts from massive sources, such as Audubon and Darwin, and intriguing pieces from lesser known authors most of us would not normally encounter. Arranged in chronological order, the small masterpieces here range from Aristotle to Rachel Carson. Each of them is introduced by an incisive and sometimes humorous description of its author.</p></p><p><p>"Good anthologies of natural history are rare. This one is unique, in my experience, for the uniform excellence of the chosen pieces. There are no undisciplined reveries, and nature is reported directly, rather than as a setting for personal introspection. This excellence is no accident, for Beebe himself was a keen observer and a master of the finest expeditionary prose."--<b>Henry S. Horn, Princeton University</b></p>"This is an anthology with a fine sense of history.... there is a timelessness to many of its selections."

Ignoring British prohibitions designed to end North America&#x2019;s wartime trade with the French, New York&#x2019;s merchant elite conducted a thriving business in the French West Indies, insisting that their behavior was protected by long practice and British commercial law. But the government in London viewed it as treachery, and its subsequent efforts to discipline North American commerce inflamed the colonists.</p><p>Through fast-moving events and unforgettable characters, historian Thomas M. Truxes brings eighteenth-century New York and the Atlantic world to life. There are spies, street riots, exotic settings, informers, courtroom dramas, interdictions on the high seas, ruthless businessmen, political intrigues, and more. The author traces each phase of the city&#x2019;s trade with the enemy and details the frustrations that affected both British officials and independent-minded New Yorkers. The first book to focus on New York City during the Seven Years&#x2019; War, <i>Defying Empire</i> reveals the important role the city played in hastening the colonies&#x2019; march toward revolution.</p></p><p><b>Thomas M.

Clinicians, backed by a grassroots movement of patients and therapists, find child sexual abuse to be the primary cause of the illness, while critics accuse the "MPD" community of fostering false memories of childhood trauma. Here the distinguished philosopher Ian Hacking uses the MPD epidemic and its links with the contemporary concept of child abuse to scrutinize today's moral and political climate, especially our power struggles about memory and our efforts to cope with psychological injuries.</p><br><p> What is it like to suffer from multiple personality? Most diagnosed patients are women: why does gender matter? How does defining an illness affect the behavior of those who suffer from it? And, more generally, how do systems of knowledge about kinds of people interact with the people who are known about? Answering these and similar questions, Hacking explores the development of the modern multiple personality movement. He then turns to a fascinating series of historical vignettes about an earlier wave of multiples, people who were diagnosed as new ways of thinking about memory emerged, particularly in France, toward the end of the nineteenth century. Fervently occupied with the study of hypnotism, hysteria, sleepwalking, and fugue, scientists of this period aimed to take the soul away from the religious sphere. What better way to do this than to make memory a surrogate for the soul and then subject it to empirical investigation?</p><br><p> Made possible by these nineteenth-century developments, the current outbreak of dissociative disorders is embedded in new political settings. <i>Rewriting the Soul</i> concludes with a powerful analysis linking historical and contemporary material in a fresh contribution to the archaeology of knowledge. As Foucault once identified a politics that centers on the body and another that classifies and organizes the human population, Hacking has now provided a masterful description of the politics of memory : the scientizing of the soul and the wounds it can receive.</p></p><p><p>"There is little Mr. Hacking leaves untouched. His book ranges from history, science and philosophical rumination to amused reflections on daily life with equal authority and grace. Mr. Hacking writes with a poetic, almost elegiac beauty."<b>--<i>The Washington Times</i></b></p><b>Ian Hacking</b> is University Professor of Philosophy and a member of the Institute for the History and Philosophy of Science and Technology at the University of Toronto.

It created a national furor comparable only to the excitement stirred by the publication, in 1866, of Crime and Punishment. To Dostoevsky, The Brothers Karamazov captured the quintessence of Russian character in all its exaltation, compassion, and profligacy. Significantly, the book was on Tolstoy's bedside table when he died. Readers in every language have since accepted Dostoevsky's own evaluation of this work and have gone further by proclaiming it one of the few great novels of all ages and countries.<br> "The Brothers Karamazov stands as the culmination of Dostoevsky's art--his last, longest, richest, and most capacious book," said The Washington Post Book World. <br> "Nothing is outside Dostoevsky's province," observed Virginia Woolf. "Out of Shakespeare there is no more exciting reading." <p><br>The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century. The series was founded in 1917 by the publishers Boni and Liveright and eight years later acquired by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer. It provided the foun-dation for their next publishing venture, Random House. The Modern Library has been a staple of the American book trade, providing readers with affordable hard-bound editions of important works of liter-ature and thought. For the Modern Library's seventy-fifth anniversary, Random House redesigned the series, restoring as its emblem the running torchbearer created by Lucian Bernhard in 1925 and refurbishing jackets, bindings, andtype, as well as inau-gurating a new program of selecting titles.

Integration extends from molecules to organ systems and from one physiological discipline to another. The book takes an entirely fresh approach to each topic. Its full-colour illustrations include many novel, visually effective features to help students learn. Each of the 25 main chapters starts with a brief animal example to engage student interest and demonstrate the value of the material that will be learned. The book includes five additional, briefer &#39;At Work&#39; chapters that apply students&#39; newfound physiological knowledge to curiosity-provoking and important topics, including diving by marine mammals, the mechanisms of navigation, and muscle plasticity in use and disuse. The book is committed to a comparative approach throughout. Whereas mammalian physiology is consistently treated in depth, emphasis is also given to the other vertebrate groups, arthropods, molluscs, and-as appropriate-additional invertebrates. Concepts and integrative themes are emphasized while giving students the specifics they need. The whole animal is the principal focus of this book. The pages are filled with information on everything from knockout mice, genomics, and enzyme chemistry to traditional organ physiology, phylogenetic analysis, and applications to human affairs. Always, the central organizing principle for the array of topics presented is to understand whole animals in the environments where they live. Complex principles are developed clearly and carefully to help students understand important concepts in sufficient depth without being overwhelmed. Pedagogical aids include embedded summaries throughout chapters, study questions, partially annotated reference lists, an extensive glossary, appendices, and an upgraded index. For all three authors, teaching physiology to undergraduate students has been a lifelong priority. The opening five chapters provide background material on physiological basics, cell-molecular concepts, genomics, physiological development, transport of solutes and water, ecology, and evolutionary biology. The remaining chapters are organized into five sections: * Food, Energy, and Temperature * Integrating Systems * Movement and Muscle * Oxygen, Carbon Dioxide, and Internal Transport * Water, Salts, and Excretion The new edition features: * A new chapter on physiological development and epigenetics (Chapter 4) * An entirely rewritten chapter on sensory processes, integrating latest research insights with organ-system physiology (Chapter 14) * Extensive rewriting, reorganization, or expansion of chapters on aerobic and anaerobic metabolism (Chapter 8), activity energetics (Chapter 9), thermal relations (Chapter 10), osmoregulation (Chapter 28), and kidney function (Chapter 29) * More than 57 new figures or tables * New boxes written by expert guest authors on topics such as fMRI, magnetoreceptors in navigation, optogenetics, sleep, and symbiosis * All chapters updated based on the latest literature and terminology * All figures and text revised as needed for pedagogical effectiveness * Updated, in-depth lists of references to the scientific literature</p><p>RICHARD W.

Asbury Park, New Jersey; and<br><br>Lou Costello (Louis Francis Cristillo) (1906-59), b. Paterson, New Jersey<br><br>The marital chemistry (or the weird mix of blunt instrument and black hole) in coupling is one of the most persistent themes in tragedy and comedy. At their best, you can't have one without the other. More than fifty years after they first tried it, Abbott and Costello's "Who's On First?" sketch is about the best remedy I know for raising laughter in a mixed bag of nuts-or for making the collection of forlorn individuals a merry mob.<br><br>Many people know the routine (written, like most of their stuff, by John Grant) by heart. Amateurs can get a good laugh out of it. But Bud and Lou achieve something lyrical, hysterical, and mythic. Watch them do the sketch and you feel the energy and hope of not just every comedian there ever was. You feel Beckett, Freud, and Wittgenstein (try it!). You see every marriage there ever was. You rejoice and despair at the impossibility of language. You wonder whether God believed in harmony, or in meetings that eternally proved our loneliness.<br><br>Lou is the one who has blood pressure, and Bud hasn't. So they are together in the world, yet together alone, doomed to explain things to each other. They are companions, halves of a whole, chums, lovers if you like. But they are a raw display of hatred, opposition, and implacable difference. They are also far better than all the amateurs. And if Lou is the performer, the valiant seeker of order, while Bud is the dumb square peg, the one who seems oblivious of audience, still, nobody did it better. If I were asked to assemble a collection of things to manifest America for the stranger, "Who's On First?" would be there-and it might be the first piece of film I'd use.<br><br>At the same time, they are not very good, rather silly, not really that far above the ocean of comedians. It isn't even that one can separate their good work from the poor. Nor is it that "Who's On First?" is simply and mysteriously superior to all the rest of their stuff. No, it's only that that routine feels an inner circle of dismay within all the others, the suffocating mantle next to Lou's heart. It isn't good, or superior; it's divine. Which is why no amount of repetition dulls it at all. I think I could watch it every day and feel the thrills and the dread as if for the first time.<br><br>They bumped into each other. Bud was a theatre cashier where Lou was playing (around 1930), and he grudgingly took the job when Lou's partner was sick. They were doing vaudeville and radio for ten years before they got their movie break at Universal: One Night in the Tropics (40, A. Edward Sutherland) was their first film, but Buck Privates (41, Arthur Lubin) was the picture that made them. There were twenty-three more films in the forties, a period for which they were steadily in the top five box-office attractions. Buck Privates, and their whole appeal, reflected the unexpected intimacies of army life.<br><br>They broke up in 1957, long since outmoded by the likes of Martin and Lewis. But there again, Abbott and Costello are the all-talking model (as opposed to the semi-silence of Laurel and Hardy) of two guys trapped in one tent.<br><br>Costello made one film on his own-for he had great creative yearnings-The 30-Foot Bride of Candy Rock (59, Sidney Miller). He died of a heart attack, which had always seemed about to happen. Bud lived on, doing next to nothing.<br>Ken (Klaus) Adam, b. Berlin, Germany, 1921<br><br>At the age of thirteen, Adam came to Britain, and stayed: he would be educated as an architect at London University and the Bartlett School of Architecture, and he served in the RAF during the war. It was in 1947 that he entered the British picture business, doing set drawings for This Was a Woman (48, Tim Whelan). Thereafter, he rose steadily as an assistant art director on The Queen of Spades (48, Thorold Dickinson); The Hidden Room (49, Edward Dmytryk); Your Witness (50, Robert Montgomery); Captain Horatio Hornblower (51, Raoul Walsh); The Crimson Pirate (52, Robert Siodmak); Helen of Troy (56, Robert Wise); he did uncredited work on Around the World in 80 Days (56, Michael Anderson), and assistant work on Ben-Hur (59, William Wyler).<br><br>Clearly, he was adept at getting hired by American directors, or on Hollywood productions, yet he did not seem overly interested in going to Hollywood. Indeed, he built a career as art director and then production designer in Britain, and he would be vitally associated with the design look and the huge, hi-tech interiors of the James Bond films: Soho Incident (56, Vernon Sewell); Night of the Demon (57, Jacques Tourneur); The Angry Hills (59, Robert Aldrich); The Rough and the Smooth (59, Siodmak); The Trials of Oscar Wilde (60, Ken Hughes); Dr. No (62, Terence Young); Sodom and Gomorrah (62, Aldrich); Dr. Strangelove (64, Stanley Kubrick); Woman of Straw (64, Basil Dearden); Goldfinger (64, Guy Hamilton); The Ipcress File (65, Sidney J. Furie); Thunderball (65, Young); Funeral in Berlin (66, Hamilton); You Only Live Twice (67, Lewis Gilbert); Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (68, Hughes); Goodbye, Mr. Chips (69, Herbert Ross); to America for The Owl and the Pussycat (70, Ross).<br><br>An international figure now, he worked increasingly in America, while keeping his British attachment to Bond and Kubrick: Diamonds Are Forever (71, Hamilton); Sleuth (72, Joseph L. Mankiewicz); The Last of Sheila (73, Ross); winning an Oscar for Barry Lyndon (75, Kubrick); Madam Kitty (76, Tinto Brass); The Seven-Per-Cent Solution (76, Ross); The Spy Who Loved Me (77, Gilbert); Moonraker (79, Gilbert).<br><br>Illness caused a significant gap in his work in the early eighties, at which time his only credit was as design consultant on Pennies from Heaven (81, Ross). Since his return, he has been based in America and Bond-less. He also seems to work on more modest projects, while staying loyal to Herb Ross: King David (85, Bruce Beresford); Crimes of the Heart (86, Beresford); The Deceivers (88, Nicholas Meyer); Dead Bang (89, John Frankenheimer); The Freshman (90, Andrew Bergman); The Doctor (91, Randa Haines); Undercover Blues (93, Ross); Addams Family Values (93, Barry Sonnenfeld); then back to Britain, with another Oscar, on The Madness of King George (94, Nicholas Hytner); Boys on the Side (95, Ross); Bogus (96, Norman Jewison); In &amp; Out (97, Frank Oz); The Out-of-Towners (99, Sam Weisman).<br>Isabelle Adjani, b. Paris, 1955<br><br>There is something so frank, so modern in her feelings, yet so classical in her aura, so passionate and so wounded, that Isabelle Adjani seems made to play Sarah Bernhardt one day. Why not? She is a natural wearer of costume capable of making us believe that the "period" world we are watching is happening now. She is bold, a mistress of her career, and has been a fiercely equal partner in her romantic relationships with Bruno Nuytten, Warren Beatty, and Daniel Day-Lewis.<br><br>Her mother was German, and her father Algerian and Turkish. When only a teenager, she was invited to join the Com�die Fran�aise, playing to great praise in Lorca and Moli�re. She has been making movies since the age of fourteen: Le Petit Bougnat (69, Bernard T. Michel); Faustine ou le Bel �t� (71, Nina Companeez); La Gifle (74, Claude Pinoteau); and made an international impact as the love-crazed girl in L'Histoire d'Ad�le H. (75, Fran�ois Truffaut), for which she won an Oscar nomination.<br><br>She was on the brink again in The Tenant (76, Roman Polanski); Barocco (76, Andr� T�chin�); Violette et Fran�ois (76, Jacques Rouffio); made an uneasy American debut in The Driver (78, Walter Hill); as a woman infatuated with the vampire in Nosferatu, Phantom der Nacht (79, Werner Herzog); as Emily in The Bront� Sisters (79, T�chin�); Possession (80, Andrzej Zulawski); and Clara et les Chics Types (80, Jacques Monnet).<br><br>She played the central victim, a version of Jean Rhys, in Quartet (81, James Ivory); L'Ann�e Prochaine si tout va bien (81, Jean-Loup Hubert); Tout Feu, Toute Flamme (82, Jean-Paul Rappeneau); Mortelle Randonn�e (82, Claude Miller); Doktor Faustus (82, Frank Seitz); as Antonieta Rivas Mercadi, a melodramatic arts patron, in Antonieta (82, Carlos Saura); was stark naked for much of L'�t� Meurtrier (82, Jean Becker), something between an erotic force of nature and a village idiot; Subway (85, Luc Besson); entirely wasted in Ishtar (87, Elaine May).<br><br>She was the producer as well as the star of Camille Claudel (88, Bruno Nuytten), her most overwhelming and characteristic performance, as a woman in love with art, exhilaration, and danger. Once more, she was nominated for the Oscar. If only Warren Beatty could have given her a role as strong. After four years, she made La Reine Margot (94, Patrice Ch�reau). Granted that she does films so seldom, why do Diabolique (96, Jeremiah S. Chechik), with Sharon Stone, or La Repentie (02, Laetitia Masson)?<br>Ben (Benjamin Geza) Affleck, b. Berkeley, California, 1972<br><br>Here is a test of critical responsibility. On the one hand, I have a soft spot for Mr. Affleck in that he is the only actor who has played, or is ever likely to play, the man who founded the school I attended. I refer to Edward (or Ned) Alleyne, the Shakespearian actor-manager and founder of Dulwich College, as offered in Shakespeare in Love (98, John Madden). I daresay I would be joined in this sentiment by other Old Alleynians-Michael Powell, Clive Brook, Leslie Howard, Raymond Chandler, P. G. Wodehouse, Michael Ondaatje, and Paul Mayersberg, among others. But I have heard not one word from any of them, or from anyone, come to that, to dispute my other view that Mr. Affleck is boring, complacent, and criminally lucky to have got away with everything so far. If there was any doubt in my mind it was settled by the mere presence-and it wasn't anything more than mere-of Affleck in the travesty called Pearl Harbor (01, Michael Bay).<br><br>Yet look what he has gotten away with: The Dark End of the Street (81, Jan Egleson); playing basketball in Buffy the Vampire Slayer (92, Fran Rubel Kuzui); School Ties (92, Robert Mandel); Dazed and Confused (93, Richard Linklater); Mallrats (95, Kevin Smith); the lead in Chasing Amy (97, Smith); Going All the Way (97, Mark Pellington); sharing in the script, and an Oscar, for Good Will Hunting (97, Gus Van Sant); Phantoms (98, Joe Chappelle); Armageddon (98, Michael Bay); 200 Cigarettes (99, Risa Bramon Garcia); Forces of Nature (99, Bronwen Hughes); Dogma (99, Smith); Boiler Room (00, Ben Younger); Reindeer Games (00, John Frankenheimer); Bounce (00, Don Roos); Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (00, Smith); Changing Lanes (02, Roger Michell); taking over as Jack Ryan in The Sum of All Fears (02, Phil Aldon Robinson).<br><br>I note that, into his early thirties, he is still playing one of the lads, just as in Pearl Harbor he was too old to be the boyhood pal of Josh Hartnett.<br>James Agee (1909-55), b. Knoxville, Tennessee<br><br>James Agee looked a lot like a young Robert Ryan; he behaved as self-destructively as Nicholas Ray; but he was only himself as a writer on film. As one of his biographers, Laurence Bergreen, has written, "To Agee movies were not primarily a form of entertainment . . . they were . . . the indigenous art form. Good or bad, vulgar or exquisite, they were, more than any literary form, the mirror of American life. They were cheap, rude, hypocritical, democratic, occasionally inspired, usually humdrum-in short, they were American. For this reason he longed to find his way, however roundabout, into them."<br><br>I take that last remark at face value: I think it was Agee's wish, not just to be involved with film people, in the making of the work, but-literally-to be in movies. That doesn't refer to some masked urge to act. It's something far more extensive: Agee wished to be perceived like a character from the best movies-intensely romantic, darkly handsome, and desirable, yet aloof, tough, moody, and doomed. Plainly, even if you know, intellectually, that some films are foolish, still, it follows that anyone wanting to live on the screen has to have faith in the grandeur and gravity of film. And so it follows that Agee's adult life coincides with the great age of self-belief in American cinema. Indeed, in 1945, he could write, in candor, "I can think of very few contemporary books that are worth the jackets they are wrapped in; I can think of very few movies, contemporary or otherwise, which fail to show that somebody who has worked on them . . . has real life or energy or intensity or intelligence or talent."<br><br>Happy days-even if from this moment in time it is easier to have more respect for books.<br><br>Agee went to Harvard, edited the Advocate, and took up booze and poetry in quantity. He was always a womanizer, and a mess personally, but he found a journalistic voice that lasted for about twenty years. It extended to the text for Let Us Now Praise Famous Men (1941), that classic of the rural Depression and hard lives, where Agee's text went with the photographs of Walker Evans-and in which Evans's photography shines with a sensuality that Agee delivered personally to some of the poor women. It also equipped him to be a film critic at Time and The Nation for much of the forties.<br><br>He was far from reliable-he could write off Kane as a reservoir of hackneyed tricks, and he was of the opinion that Chaplin and Huston were without equal in America. But he wrote like someone who had not just viewed the movie but been in it-out with it, as if it were a girl; drinking with it; driving in the night with it. That direct physical response was new, it was done with terrific dash and insight, and it surely intuited the way people responded to movies in the forties. It was also, it seems to me, a powerful influence on Pauline Kael-I have a fond dream of the two of them snarling at each other, like the characters in The African Queen.<br><br>Which brings us to the vexed matter of Agee's scripts. From the mid forties on, Agee made a set at Huston-it was authentic admiration, or hero worship, but it was also a pioneering case of the movie critic lusting to sit at the all-night dinner with the big guys and walk away with a writing job. Agee worked on the script and commentary of The Quiet One (49, Sidney Meyers); he did a script for The African Queen (51, Huston), which was substantially redone by others; he did the "Bride Comes to Yellow Sky" episode from Face to Face (52, John Brahm and Bretaigne Windust), and he wrote the first screenplay for The Night of the Hunter (55, Charles Laughton).</p><h2>Coming Alive From Nine to Five in a 24/7 World : A Career Search Handbook for the 21st Century</h2><p>&#34;Coming Alive from Nine to Five in a 24/7 World&#34; is both a unique handbook and a handy reference book that develops and demystifies the career/lifestyle search.

It is also a rare book: most defenses of the faith do not make the gospel their lodestar and template. This one breaks new ground in letting the reason for the Christian hope--Jesus crucified and risen--guide and govern the forms and methods of faith's defense. Apologetics at the Cross incorporates biblical materials, the history of apologetics, and theology to make a cumulative case for the church as a socially embodied cruciform argument whose members are alert to how different people may need to be shown various different paths (i.e., kinds of arguments) that lead to, and into, the reality of the gospel. This is a book brim full of apologetic wisdom--most notably, the wisdom of the cross. -- Kevin J. Vanhoozer, Research Professor of Systematic Theology, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School<br><br>In our culture, the practice of apologetics has moved from being a 'boutique' topic for specialists to being a requirement for even having a conversation with one's neighbor. Joshua Chatraw and Mark Allen have produced the most comprehensive, accessible, and up-to-date manual on Christian apologetics that I know of. Despite how full its treatment of the subject, it is eminently readable. The authors present all the various approaches to apologetics respectfully, proposing their own pathway that incorporates a large range of insights from many disciplines and thinkers. Highly recommended. -- Timothy Keller, pastor emeritus, the Redeemer Presbyterian Churches of New York City<br><br>One of the best books about apologetics I've read. It offers a compelling vision for the place of apologetics in the life of individual believers and the church, drawing on the rich wisdom of the Christian past and the best recent approaches to the apologetic task. This book will both enrich the lives of Christians and help them defend and commend their faith in today's complex world. -- Alister E. McGrath, professor of science and religion, University of Oxford<br><br>Just when you think this book is the comprehensive apologetics textbook you've been looking for--covering Scripture, history, philosophy, and culture--you realize it's also something more: a creative, original proposal for an 'inside-out' apologetic that is precisely what we need in our secular age. If you're skittish about 'apologetics,' like I am, this book will show you another way. -- James K. A. Smith, professor of philosophy, Calvin College, and author of You Are What You Love<br><br>Imagine a book on apologetics that not only deals with content, but discusses tone and heart, is gentle and wise, and overviews method and approach with care and balance. That is Apologetics at the Cross. Not only does it walk through the common questions; it orients one to the different ways people think and relate to those issues. Here is a book that does apologetics with depth, not just of the mind, but of the soul. -- Darrell Bock, Center for Christian Leadership and Cultural Engagement, Dallas Theological Seminary<br><br>Drawing on key biblical themes and the best of the Christian tradition, Josh Chatraw and Mark Allen have provided readers with a much-needed work for those looking to think more deeply about the Christian faith and the importance of Christian apologetics for our post-Christian world.

Veteran teacher Denise Pope follows five highly regarded students through a school year and discovers that these young people believe getting ahead requires manipulating the system, scheming, lying, and cheating. On the one hand,&nbsp;they work hard in school, participate in extracurricular activities, serve their communities, earn awards and honors, and appear to uphold school values. But on the other hand, they feel that in order to get ahead they must compromise their values. In short, they &#x201c;do school&#x201d;&#x2014;that is, they are not really engaged with learning nor can they commit to such values as integrity and community.<br><br>The words and actions of these five students&#x2014;two boys and three girls from diverse ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds&#x2014;underscore the frustrations of being caught in a &#x201c;grade trap&#x201d; that pins future success to high grades and test scores. Their stories raise critical questions that are too important for parents, educators, and community leaders to ignore. Are schools cultivating an environment that promotes intellectual curiosity, cooperation, and integrity? Or are they fostering anxiety, deception, and hostility? Do today&#x2019;s schools inadvertently impede the very values they claim to embrace? Is the &#x201c;success&#x201d; that current assessment practices measure the kind of success we want for our children?<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Named by American School Board Journal as a Notable Book in Education"A troubling portrait of the deeply embedded and corrosive attitudes and expectations that students encounter even in America&#x2019;s most favored elite secondary schools."&#x2014;Theodore R. Sizer, Brown University; "The book raises disturbing questions about the kind of &#x2018;high standards&#x2019; we are pushing for in our schools. It should inform any discussion of what it means to be an educated person in the 21st century."&#x2014;Edward B. Fiske, former Education Editor of the New York Times</p><h2>Macbeth (Simply Shakespeare)</h2><p>This tragedy tells of a power-hungry Scottish nobleman and his lady, and the price they pay for violently seizing the royal throne. Books in this new, illustrated series present complete texts of Shakespeare's plays. However, the lines are set up so students can see the bard's original poetic phrases printed side-by-side and line-by-line with a modern "translation" on the facing page. <br><br>Starting in the late 1580s and for several decades that followed, Shakespeare's plays were popular entertainment for London's theatergoers. His Globe Theatre was the equivalent of a Broadway theater in today's New York. The plays have endured, but over the course of 400+ years, the English language has changed in many ways&#x2014;which is why today's students often find Shakespeare's idiom difficult to comprehend. <br><br><i>Simply Shakespeare</i> offers an excellent solution to their problem. Introducing each play is a general essay covering Shakespeare's life and times. At the beginning of each of the five acts in every play, a two-page spread describes what is about to take place. The story's background is explained, followed by brief descriptions of key people who will appear in the act, details students should watch for as the story unfolds, discussion of the play's historical context, how the play was staged in Shakespeare's day, and explanation of puns and plays on words that occur in characters' dialogues.<br><br> Identifying icons preceding each of these study points are printed in a second color, then are located again as cross-references in the play's original text. For instance, where words spoken by a person in the play offer insights into his or another character's personality, the "Characters" icon will appear as a cross-reference in both the introductory spread and the play proper. Following each act, a closing spread presents questions and discussion points for use as teachers' aids. Guided by the inspiring format of this fine new series, both teachers and students will come to understand and appreciate the genius of Shakespeare as never before.</p><p>An exciting new edition of the complete works of Shakespeare with these features: Illustrated with photographs from New York Shakespeare Festival productions, vivid readable readable introductions for each play by noted scholar David Bevington, a lively personal foreword by Joseph Papp, an insightful essay on the play in performance, modern spelling and pronunciation, up-to-date annotated bibliographies, and convenient listing of key passages.Infamously known as the cursed Scottish play, Macbeth is perhaps Shakespeare's darkest tragedy. When General Macbeth is foretold by three witches that he will one day be King of Scotland, Lady Macbeth convinces him to get rid of anyone who could stand in his way including committing regicide. As Macbeth ascends to the throne through bloody murder, he becomes a tyrant consumed by fear and paranoia. <p> An L.A.

Set during the T'ang dynasty, they feature Judge Dee, a brilliant and cultured Confucian magistrate disdainful of personal luxury and corruption, who cleverly selects allies to help him navigate the royal courts, politics, and ethnic tensions in imperial China. Robert van Gulik modeled Judge Dee on a magistrate of that name who lived in the seventh century, and he drew on stories and literary conventions of Chinese mystery writing dating back to the Sung dynasty to construct his ingenious plots.<br> <br> <i>Necklace and Calabash</i> finds Judge Dee returning to his district of Poo-yang, where the peaceful town of Riverton promises a few days' fishing and relaxation. Yet a chance meeting with a Taoist recluse, a gruesome body fished out of the river, strange guests at the Kingfisher Inn, and a princess in distress thrust the judge into one of the most intricate and baffling mysteries of his career.<br> <br> An expert on the art and erotica as well as the literature, religion, and politics of China, van Gulik also provides charming illustrations to accompany his engaging and entertaining mysteries.</p></p><p>Due to its proximity to the Water Palace, the summer residence of the Emperor&#39;s favorite daughter, Riverton lies within a Special Area administered by the military. To Judge Dee, returning to his district of Poo-yang, the peaceful town promises a few days&#39; fishing and relaxation. But it is not to be. A chance meeting with a Taoist recluse, a gruesome body fished out of the river, strange guests at the Kingfisher Inn, a princess in distress--before long the judge is facing one of the most intricate and baffling mysteries of his career.<b>Robert Van Gulik</b> (1910-67) was a Dutch diplomat and an authority on Chinese history and culture. He drew his plots from the whole body of Chinese literature, especially from the popular detective novels that first appeared in the seventeenth century.</p><h2>The Fantastic Laboratory of Dr. Weigl: How Two Brave Scientists Battled Typhus and Sabotaged the Nazis</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;Thought-provoking...[Allen] writes without sanctimony and never simplifies the people in his book or the moral issues his story inevitably raises." &#x2015;<em>Wall Street Journal</em></strong></p><p>Few diseases are more gruesome than typhus. Transmitted by body lice, it afflicts the dispossessed&#x2015;refugees, soldiers, and ghettoized peoples&#x2015;causing hallucinations, terrible headaches, boiling fever, and often death. The disease plagued the German army on the Eastern Front and left the Reich desperate for a vaccine. For this they turned to the brilliant and eccentric Polish zoologist Rudolf Weigl.</p><p>In the 1920s, Weigl had created the first typhus vaccine using a method as bold as it was dangerous for its use of living human subjects. The astonishing success of Weigl&#x2019;s techniques attracted the attention and admiration of the world&#x2015;giving him cover during the Nazi&#x2019;s violent occupation of Lviv. His lab soon flourished as a hotbed of resistance. Weigl hired otherwise doomed mathematicians, writers, doctors, and other thinkers, protecting them from atrocity. The team engaged in a sabotage campaign by sending illegal doses of the vaccine into the Polish ghettos while shipping gallons of the weakened serum to the Wehrmacht.</p><p>Among the scientists saved by Weigl, who was a Christian, was a gifted Jewish immunologist named Ludwik Fleck. Condemned to Buchenwald and pressured to re-create the typhus vaccine under the direction of a sadistic Nazi doctor, Erwin Ding-Schuler, Fleck had to make an awful choice between his scientific ideals or the truth of his conscience. In risking his life to carry out a dramatic subterfuge to vaccinate the camp&#x2019;s most endangered prisoners, Fleck performed an act of great heroism.</p><p>Drawing on extensive research and interviews with survivors, Arthur Allen tells the harrowing story of two brave scientists&#x2015;a Christian and a Jew&#x2015; who put their expertise to the best possible use, at the highest personal danger.</p> 35 illustrations</p><p>Arthur Allen has written for the New York Times Magazine, the Washington Post, The Atlantic, the Associated Press, Science, and Slate. His books include Vaccine: The Controversial Story of Medicine&#x2019;s Greatest Lifesaver. He lives in Washington, where he writes about health for Politico.&#x201c;It is the story of [producing an effective typhus vaccine] that Allen tells&#x2015;and tells very well.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Washington Post</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Astonishing.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Politico</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Fascinating.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Tilli Tansey, <em>Nature</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Allen&#x2019;s vivid depictions of the scientific community before and during the war and the treacherous parallel paths Weigl and Fleck traversed&#x2015;gleaned in part from interviews with Holocaust survivors&#x2015;are stirring. Considering all the energy channeled into mere survival, Allen&#x2019;s book makes you wonder what pinnacles of research might have been achieved by now, if not for the march of war.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Laura Fischer Kaiser, <em>ScienceNews</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Wholly surprising and affecting.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jonathan Kirsch, <em>Jewish Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;An extraordinary story of medical research amid horror...Unforgettable.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>George Makari, author of <em>Revolution in Mind: The Creation of Psychoanalysis</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A combination of <em>Microbe Hunters</em>, <em>Schindler&#x2019;s List,</em> and <em>The Twilight Zone</em>.

(<i>Best Books for Young Adult Readers</i> )Mapping the Civil War is a cottage industry that began during the war and has prospered ever since. In official reports and popular histories issued after the war, numerous maps gave military movement and battles a geographical clarity and purpose they often lacked for the soldiers fighting. In this useful compendium of maps, largely made up of David Greenspan's pictorial maps originally drawn for Bruce Catton's American Heritage Illustrated History of the Civil War (1960) and various hand-drawn and -printed wartime maps, the importance of maps in military history and in the history of the war becomes evident. The maps cover 15 major battles/campaigns, from Bull Run to Nashville--each introduced by a serviceable description of the engagement and supplemented by illustrations. Still, this book offers little that is new or surprising. Recommended only for those libraries that lack the Catton volume and The Official Military Atlas of the Civil War (1978) or other reliable collections of Civil War maps.<br><i>- Randall M.

From preventing unnecessarily high taxes to avoiding unconscionably high fees, this common-sense guidebook for independent investors reveals how to:</p> <ul> <li>Match your investment program to the realities of the market and work effectively with your investment managers </li><li>Make the most of the "unfair" index fund advantage in today's tumultuous market environment </li><li>Keep from getting burned by the market's inevitable up-and-down cycles </li><li>Institute an annual review process that includes both your and your heirs' lifelines </li><li>Maximize financial success through five stages, from Earning, Saving, and Investing through Estate Planning and Giving </li></ul> <p>In today's markets, an unprecedented quarter-century of performance has blinded investors to the historical base rate of investment returns. <i>Winning the Loser's Game </i>cuts through the fog like a beacon of common sense and clarity, and helps you to see how today's most highly touted shortcuts and secrets are almost always guaranteed to hurt you in the long run. With updated facts and figures and six new chapters, it sidesteps complications and formulas to provide you with the straight-talking secrets to winning investing.</p><p><b>Charles D.

R. Smith</b> is a fellow at the Heyman Center for the Humanities at Columbia University. He is the author or editor of sixteen scholarly books, and he continues to lecture widely in the United States and abroad.<b>From Bruce L. R. Smith&#x2019;s Introduction to <i>The Deerslayer<br><br></i></b><p>James Fenimore Cooper&#x2019;s literary reputation has undergone striking vicissitudes over the years. Hailed in his lifetime (1789&#x2013;1851) as America&#x2019;s first great novelist and lionized throughout the Western world, he fell into the literary doldrums at the end of the nineteenth century (in his own country at least) and languished there for many years. So complete was his fall that he became almost an object of ridicule among critics and literary commissioners. Later generations found it hard to imagine that he had once been an icon in the American literary canon. More recently, however, there has been a revival of interest in Cooper and a reconsideration of his literary reputation. </p><p>His death in Cooperstown on September 14, 1851, and a memorial service held the next month in New York City brought tributes from Daniel Webster, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, Washington Irving, Henry Longfellow, William Cullen Bryant, and other leading American men of letters. In Europe, Thackeray, Balzac, Goethe, Scott, Lafayette, Carlyle, Sand, and Sue were among the many admirers of Cooper&#x2019;s writings. So were, later, Joseph Conrad, who paid tribute in particular to Cooper&#x2019;s seafaring works, and D. H. Lawrence, who was so inspired by Cooper&#x2019;s treatment of the frontier that he came to spend several years living in the American West. Cooper was probably even more popular in Europe than he was in his own country, and he earned much of the money he made as America&#x2019;s first successful professional writer from overseas sales of his works. </p><p>A controversialist, Cooper provoked unease from his countrymen as well as veneration. His popularity waned after his return to America in 1833 from a seven-year absence spent traveling in Europe; upon his return, he criticized the materialism and crassness he saw in America that had changed for the worse. He was not afraid to join in political fights and to hit back at enemies&#x2014;he became something of a public scold in his later years, and he emulated his father&#x2019;s recourse to the courts to redress wrongs. He stirred the ire of Whig newspaper publishers who had always distrusted him and disliked, in particular, his novels <i>Homeward Bound</i> (1838)<i></i> and <i>Home as Found </i>(1838). He was variously assailed at different times for being too Jacksonian and hostile to authority, and for being too aristocratic and class conscious. It is doubtful, however, whether Cooper really felt comfortable with any political party, and his political ideas certainly did not add up to a coherent political philosophy. He was nominally a Jackson Democrat but had a strong distrust of populist sentiments and of demagogues who stirred up the uneducated masses. Although a charming and gregarious man in his youth, Cooper came to be almost a recluse in later years and at times displayed a gift for making enemies. Many of the attacks on Cooper, though, <i>were</i> libelous, for he won the suits he instituted. </p><p>Cooper was wedded to his upstate New York region but was also a cosmopolitan who traveled widely; he was a romantic spinner of tales but also a realist who closely observed social mores, manners, and class status even in his novels set in the wilderness. Cooper was an optimist but one with a paranoid streak and a dark side. He lived mostly in the company of women but wrote mostly about men, male friendships, and heroes who broke free of or who never knew the bonds of domesticity. Cooper was as hard a man to understand for his contemporaries as he is for us now. Was he a reactionary or a man ahead of his times, an apologist for white America or a champion of Native Americans? Did he affirm the conquest of the wilderness or was he an early ecologist? As Robert Emmet Long comments, &#x201c;Two centuries after his birth, he remains an American enigma&#x201d; (<i>James Fenimore Cooper</i>, p. 13; see &#x201c;For Further Reading&#x201d;). </p><p>Yet for all of the controversy his life stirred, Cooper&#x2019;s literary reputation remained largely intact until the end of the nineteenth century. He was, indeed, a cultural icon in a broad sense. His fiction redefined the past for the country, invented the idea of the Western frontier, and gave Americans a mythic sense of themselves and their destiny. He was a patron of the visual arts. Cooper&#x2019;s writings stimulated interest in American history and fostered the professional writing of history, even though his novels often subordinated historical reality to archetype and myth. His interest in the Navy was genuine and was grounded in firsthand experience, and he was familiar with many of the personages he wrote about in <i>The History of the Navy of the United States of America</i> (1839), which was a classic study of its kind. Cooper&#x2019;s friend George Bancroft, the distinguished Harvard historian, interpreted the American Revolution in terms similar to the story lines and subtexts of Cooper&#x2019;s novels dealing with the revolution, and he patterned his style of narrative history writing after Cooper&#x2019;s narrative techniques. Moreover, Cooper did much to fashion and to expand the popular audience for his novels (and for the writers who followed him). His works were issued and reissued after his death.</p></p><h2>Precalculus: A Concise Course</h2><p>With the same design and feature sets as the market leading Precalculus, 9/e, this concise text provides both students and instructors with sound, consistently structured explanations of the mathematical concepts.

She was educated in London and Paris, and began publishing articles and stories in the 1920s. In 1931 she brought out her first book, a memoir entitled<i> Three Houses</i>, and in 1933 her comic novel <i>High Rising</i> - set in the fictional county of Barsetshire, borrowed from Trollope - met with great success.

Organized around various sciences, such as physics, genetics, and microbiology, the book explains the connection between traditional medicine and current research around epigenetics and quantum physics, for example, and includes over 600 citations. Redvers, who has traveled and worked with Indigenous groups around the world, shares the knowledge and teachings of health and wellness that have been passed down through the generations, tying this knowledge with current scientific advances. Knowing that the science backs up the traditional practice allows us to have earlier and more specific interventions that integrate age-old techniques with the advances in modern medicine and technology.</p><p>DR. NICOLE REDVERS is the first licensed practicing naturopathic doctor in North America who is Dene (a member of the Deninu K&#39;ue First Nation Band). After growing up in Canada&#39;s isolated north, she pursued an advanced Western medical education in the south and has had the privilege of developing relationships with strong elders and medicine people. She has traveled the globe, studying traditional medicine systems in various countries and working with Indigenous patients, helping to bridge the gap between traditional and modern medical systems. In addition, Redvers developed Northern Canada&#39;s only integrative medicine clinic from the ground up. She also co-founded and chairs a non-profit group, the Arctic Indigenous Wellness Foundation (AIWF), whose purpose is to revitalize traditional wellness services in the Canadian north and to focus on the preservation of Traditional Medicines. Her foundation was awarded one million dollars as a Laureate of the 2017 Arctic Inspiration Prize to work with homeless people and those most at risk in the northern part of Canada.&#x201c;Redvers illuminates the common ground that underlies both traditional and conventional healing practices. Each chapter identifies and analyzes the different cultural assumptions that can keep healing practices separate from one another, while the depth of the author&#x2019;s knowledge allows us to see the ways in which these different practices can be rooted in the wisdom of the body. A call for the holistic healing that integrates multiple traditions for healing of mind, body, emotion, and spirit.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Robin Wall Kimmerer, PhD, author of <i>Braiding Sweetgrass</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Drawing on her own unique upbringing and total lived experience&#x2014;melding wisdom received from her Dene elders of Northern Canada and lessons learned from witnessing illness, poverty, despair, and environmental degradation in various parts of the world&#x2014;Redvers provides unique insight that only a First Nations person and practicing integrative medicine doctor can bring. <i>The Science of the Sacred</i> is a compass pointing toward a much-needed rebellion in healing.

Logan, coauthor of <i>Your Brain on Nature</i><br><br>&#x201c;Nicole Redvers neatly ties together her cultural Dene roots and stories from other Indigenous cultures in an evidence-informed manner to look at medicine, the health of our planet, and the health of humans as individuals and societies. She poses questions and solutions that deserve exploration and will keep you thinking long after finishing this, her first work.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Paul Saunders, PhD, ND<br><br>&#x201c;This is a powerful and courageous book of personal and planetary healing. It points directly to the core of all of our problems, where also lie the path to our solutions. Drawing on modern science and the ancient wisdom of the First Nations Elders it makes a resounding call for change, carefully balancing the well-reasoned practicalities with the inspiration and passion needed to achieve these. In a cataclysmic era for human and planetary health a seismic shift is needed&#x2014;that we may rediscover our purpose, our roots and our sense of self, from which all else flows. Dr Redvers takes us boldly to that frontier, and shows us where we might cross the threshold to a new era of health.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&#x2014;Susan Prescott, MD, PhD, president of inVIVO Planetary Health, paediatrician and immunologist, University of Western Australia</p><h2>The Serengeti Rules: The Quest to Discover How Life Works and Why It Matters</h2><p><p><b>Now the subject of a feature film that the <i>New York Times</i> calls "spellbinding"</b></p><p>How does life work? How does nature produce the right numbers of zebras and lions on the African savanna, or fish in the ocean? How do our bodies produce the right numbers of cells in our organs and bloodstream? In <i>The Serengeti Rules</i>, award-winning biologist and author Sean Carroll tells the stories of the pioneering scientists who sought the answers to such simple yet profoundly important questions, and shows how their discoveries matter for our health and the health of the planet we depend upon.</p><p>One of the most important revelations about the natural world is that everything is regulated&#x2015;there are rules that regulate the amount of every molecule in our bodies and rules that govern the numbers of every animal and plant in the wild. And the most surprising revelation about the rules that regulate life at such different scales is that they are remarkably similar&#x2015;there is a common underlying logic of life. Carroll recounts how our deep knowledge of the rules and logic of the human body has spurred the advent of revolutionary life-saving medicines, and makes the compelling case that it is now time to use the Serengeti Rules to heal our ailing planet.</p><p>A bold and inspiring synthesis by one of our most accomplished biologists and gifted storytellers, <i>The Serengeti Rules</i> is the first book to illuminate how life works at vastly different scales. Read it and you will never look at the world the same way again.</p></p><p><p>"A master storyteller, Carroll explores the unity of biology from the molecular level to the Serengeti, the rules that regulate life, and the consequences when regulation breaks down. A fascinating journey from beginning to end, this book will educate and entertain readers at all levels and leave them with a better understanding of how the biosphere works."<b>--Simon Levin, Princeton University, author of <i>Fragile Dominion: Complexity and the Commons</i></b></p><p>"<i>The Serengeti Rules</i> is a superb journey of a book written by a scientist of the first rank.

Wilson, Harvard University</b></p><p>"As one of our leading biologists and communicators, Sean Carroll has merged a passion for scientific discovery with a flair for telling great stories of exploration. In <i>The Serengeti Rules</i>, Carroll has crafted a work of epic sweep that travels the globe in search of the logical rules that govern all of life, from tiny molecules to entire ecosystems. <i>The Serengeti Rules</i> both delights and enlightens--I was left marveling at the human achievement behind scientific breakthroughs and the sheer beauty of the working of living systems."<b>--Neil Shubin, author of <i>Your Inner Fish: A Journey into the 3.5-Billion-Year History of the Human Body</i></b></p><p>"Original, provocative, and beautifully crafted, Carroll's book provides a glimpse into the deeper laws of biology that govern the earth. With his inimitable style of storytelling combined with a deep knowledge of science, Carroll takes us on a rollicking adventure, reminding us that the rules that apply to ecosystems also apply to the human body. This book is a must-read for anyone who cares about the future of the planet."<b>--Siddhartha Mukherjee, author of <i>The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer</i></b></p><p>"This is a rattling good read by one of the leading scientists of our time. <i>The Serengeti Rules</i> made me think differently about what we biologists do.

In <i>The Lost World</i>, Doyle, a devotee of the occult and fantastic tales of adventure and discovery, introduces his readers to Professor Challenger, an eccentric paleontologist, on his suspense-filled search for prehistoric creatures in the wilds of the Amazon. Professor Challenger's doughty troupe includes a skeptical colleague, Professor Summerlee; the cool-headed, plucky sportsman Lord John Roxton; and the narrator, the intrepid reporter Edward Malone. When their bridge to civilization collapses, the explorers find themselves marooned among dinosaurs and savage ape-people.<br>Originally published in 1912, this imaginative fantasy unfolds with humor and good-natured satirical eye for pedantry. Fans of Arthur Conan Doyle will delight in this rare gem, as will dinosaur fanciers and adventure story aficionados.</p></p><p>Forget the Michael Crichton book (and Spielberg movie) that copied the title. This is the original: the terror-adventure tale of <i>The Lost World</i>. Writing not long after dinosaurs first invaded the popular imagination, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle spins a yarn about an expedition of two scientists, a big-game hunter, and a journalist (the narrator) to a volcanic plateau high over the vast Amazon rain forest. The bickering of the professors (a type Doyle knew well from his medical training) serves as witty contrast to the wonders of flora and fauna they encounter, building toward a dramatic moonlit chase scene with a Tyrannosaurus Rex. And the character of Professor George E. Challenger is second only to Sherlock Holmes in the outrageous force of his personality: he's a big man with an even bigger ego, and if you can grit your teeth through his racist behavior toward Native Americans, he's a lot of fun.6 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Glencoe Literature � 2002 Course 5, Grade 10 : The Reader&#39;s Choice</h2><p><p><i>"The two most engaging powers of an author are to make new things familiar, and familiar things new."</i> - Samuel Johnson (1709-1784)</p><p><i>Glencoe Literature</i> for 2002 also "makes new things familiar and familiar things new."

Kreps has developed a text in microeconomics that is both challenging and "user-friendly." The work is designed for the first-year graduate microeconomic theory course and is accessible to advanced undergraduates as well. Placing unusual emphasis on modern noncooperative game theory, it provides the student and instructor with a unified treatment of modern microeconomic theory--one that stresses the behavior of the individual actor (consumer or firm) in various institutional settings. The author has taken special pains to explore the fundamental assumptions of the theories and techniques studied, pointing out both strengths and weaknesses.</p><p>The book begins with an exposition of the standard models of choice and the market, with extra attention paid to choice under uncertainty and dynamic choice. General and partial equilibrium approaches are blended, so that the student sees these approaches as points along a continuum. The work then turns to more modern developments. Readers are introduced to noncooperative game theory and shown how to model games and determine solution concepts. Models with incomplete information, the folk theorem and reputation, and bilateral bargaining are covered in depth. Information economics is explored next. A closing discussion concerns firms as organizations and gives readers a taste of transaction-cost economics.</p></p><p>This book provides an introduction to the content and methods of microeconomic theory. The primary target for this book is a first-year graduate student who is looking for an introduction to microeconomic theory that goes beyond the traditional models of the consumer, the firm, and the market."The most complete, enjoyable, and worthwhile textbook treating both traditional and modern microeconomic theory."

What makes its popularity and tenacity even more remarkable is that all existing versions of <i>Darkness at Noon</i> are based on a hastily made English translation of the original German by a novice translator at the outbreak of World War II.<br> <br> In 2015, Matthias We�el stumbled across an entry in the archives of the Zurich Central Library that is a scholar's dream: &#x201c;Koestler, Arthur. Rubaschow: Roman. Typoskript, M�rz 1940, 326 pages.&#x201d; What he had found was Arthur Koestler&#x2019;s original, complete German manuscript for what would become <i>Darkness at Noon</i>, thought to have been irrevocably lost in the turmoil of the war. With this stunning literary discovery, and a new English translation direct from the primary German manuscript, we can now for the first time read <i>Darkness at Noon</i> as Koestler wrote it.<br> <br> Set in the 1930s at the height of the purge and show trials of a Stalinist Moscow, <i>Darkness at Noon </i>is a haunting portrait of an aging revolutionary, Nicholas Rubashov, who is imprisoned, tortured, and forced through a series of hearings by the Party to which he has dedicated his life. As the pressure to confess preposterous crimes increases, he re-lives a career that embodies the terrible ironies and betrayals of a merciless totalitarian movement masking itself as an instrument of deliverance.<br> <br> Koestler&#x2019;s portrayal of Stalin-era totalitarianism and fascism is as chilling and resonant today as it was in the 1940s and during the Cold War. Rubashov&#x2019;s plight explores the meaning and value of moral choices, the attractions and dangers of idealism, and the corrosiveness of political corruption.

In 1940 he published his novel&nbsp;<i>Darkness at Noon</i>, an anti-totalitarian work that gained him international fame. Over the course of his life, Koestler espoused many political causes. His novels, reportage, autobiographical works, and political and cultural writings established him as an important commentator on the dilemmas of the twentieth century."It is the sort of novel that transcends ordinary limitations...written with such dramatic power, with such warmth of feeling, and with such persuasive simplicity...The magic effect of <i>Darkness at Noon</i>&nbsp;is its magnificent tragic irony.", <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"A rare and beautifully executed novel."<br> &nbsp;, <i>New York Herald Tribune</i><br><br>"There is nothing stilted about the new&nbsp;<i>Darkness at Noon</i>.

Book is in Very good condition throughout. A Projected Visit To A Lighthouse By A Family On Holiday In Skye-almost Entirely By Reflections Within The Minds Of The Characters.</p><p>Mrs Ramsay (wife of a distinguished philosopher, mother of eight, and a sympathetic hostess) provides the heartbeat of a shabby-grand holiday house in the Hebrides and at the same time ceaselessly gauges the secret rhythms of its many intertwined pulses. Hers is the dominant interior monologue of this pre-first-world-war interlude. Other voices (most notably that of unmarried artist Lily Briscoe) fade in and out, and Juliet Stevenson turns this haunting story, in which nothing really happens, into a tone-poem of delicately nuanced probings into human relationships. The mood deepens when the neglected house is revisited, post-war, by surviving members of the holiday party, who must ultimately confront 'that loneliness that was the truth about things'. --Karen Robinson, The Sunday Times<br><br>Nicole Kidman in The Hours may have raised the doyenne of Bloomsbury bluestockings literary profile for a new generation of readers, but many people still consider Virginia Woolf's writing difficult and dated. It is. You either go along with descriptions such as, 'the spring, without a leaf to toss, bare and bright like a virgin fierce in her chastity, scornful in her purity, was laid out on fields, wide-eyed and watchful, and entirely careless of what was done, or thought, by the beholders...', or you don't. Somehow, though, when it is read in a voice as sensitive and intelligent as Juliet Stevenson's, you appreciate why critics have said that this, her best-known novel, contains some of the most beautiful prose ever written. Just as well, because there isn't much plot. The action, such as it is, takes place in the holiday home of the Ramsay family, on a Hebridean island before and after the great war. Mrs Ramsay is beautiful, Mr Ramsay difficult, their eight children relatively interesting, their house guests more so. It's the relationships that count, constantly shifting and elusive, dependent on a glance, a trick of light, an inflection of tone. Naxos does an abridged version, but don t be tempted. Woolf is all or nothing. --Sue Arnold, The Guardian<br><br>Thinking about my own reaction to To the Lighthouse, I enjoyed it more because of Juliet Stevenson's reading of it. She carried me along in the middle section when I was losing my way. And then I got fired up for it again. What the audiobook did was to impose some additional (and quite helpful) structure on the book. For example the last four tracks are called In the boat, Perspective, Approaching and Arriving. --Pete, Couch trip blogWith introductions by Eavan Boland and Maud Ellmann</p><h2>Tilings and Patterns</h2><p>"Remarkable...

For nearly 500 years, and for countless people, it has provided a background fanfare for a marriage or a funeral march at a burial. Yet this familiarity also hides a violent and controversial history. When it was first produced the<em> Book of Common Prayer</em> provoked riots and rebellion, and it was banned before being translated into a host of global languages and adopted as the basis for worship in the USA and elsewhere to the present day. <br><br>This edition presents the work in three different states: the first edition of 1549, which brought the Reformation into people's homes; the Elizabethan prayer book of 1559, familiar to Shakespeare and Milton; and the edition of 1662, which embodies the religious temper of the nation down to modern times. <br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics </strong>has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

She discusses how to make stone and crystal elixirs for internal and topical use, how to charge quartz with the healing properties of other stones, how to cleanse and recharge a stone after use, and how to combine stones to create healing formulas for individual conditions. She explains different techniques of wearing stones as healing jewelry and how to use them in massage and energy work. She examines the chemistry and sacred geometry of crystal structure, revealing how the minerals contained in the stones affect our physiology by supporting our Jing (Essence); by nourishing Qi (energy), blood, and fluids; and by clearing Wind, Cold, Damp, and Heat conditions that can lead to disease. <br><br>Including a thorough primer on Traditional Chinese Medicine and backed by modern scientific research, this book explains how stones access our deepest layers, vibrating ever so slowly, to initiate deep lasting change.</p><p>Leslie J.

She lives in Belchertown, Massachusetts.<b>Chapter 14</b><br><br><b>Transformative Stones<br><br></b>If quartz crystals represent perfection in the world of minerals, the transformative stones demonstrate the process by which perfection is accomplished. In Western terminology, this large group of stones is called chalcedony. It includes agate, chalcedony, jasper, and onyx. The stones are fundamentally the same--that is, a fibrous subcategory of quartz, all with similar hardness and all with a chemical composition of silicon dioxide. For the ancient Chinese, however, who saw consciousness and spirit in the natural world, the patterns, colors, and configurations these stones presented were indications of a process of refinement and evolution. <br><br>Most of the transformative stones form at the Source/Yuan, or igneous level, but their appearance shows a process of metamorphosis. The stones are quartz, but they do not form perfect crystals. They demonstrate a slow evolutionary process as the Earth adapts to change. They also represent a core tension of human life--the relationship between Water, our Essence, and its requirement to discover and express our deepest self, and Earth, with its requirements of living in society. Looking at the agates, with their banded, speckled, or patchy appearances, we can imagine the struggles and conflicts the stones experience during their creation--as they melt and solidify, compress and release, fuse and separate. Eventually the stones refine to become the strong, definitive colors of the jaspers; the translucent, homogenous colors of the chalcedonies; or the shining, intensely black onyx, which represents our deepest Essence: the Water energy of the Kidneys. The group as a whole matures to its ultimate perfection in the subtlety and elegance of jade, a stone held in the highest regard since the earliest history of the Chinese.<br><br> The use of jade in Chinese culture dates to the Neolithic period, when ancient populations considered the nephrite jade they were able to mine locally to be inherently more valuable than gold or silver. They used the stone to shape ritual objects and tools, and the quality of the carving gives evidence to a highly sophisticated civilization. Nephrite jade is extremely durable, as demonstrated by the many jade artifacts unearthed that date back to more than 1,000 years before the Common Era. <br><br>In the nineteenth century, a beautiful jade from Burma became popular among the royalty and Confucian scholars. It had clearer and bolder colors than the indigenous nephrite jade, and the bright emerald-green color, called imperial green, was much sought after. This is jadeite. It has a different chemical composition than nephrite jade, but this difference was unknown until later in the century. <br><br>Jade is associated with the upper dan tian. We use agates, jasper, and chalcedony for treating illness, but jade is an aspirational stone. It represents the possibility to ascend out of petty, selfish concerns and to exhibit qualities of behavior that benefit all humans.</p><h2>Follow Me: Becoming a Lifestyle Prayerwalker</h2><p>A six-week Bible study that will transform a willing believer into an effective prayerwalker.

They pinpoint key ideas and offer clear explanations of why things are done in a particular way. Moreover, as a teaching tool, the instructor can emphasize to the students that these are the types of questions they should ask themselves whenever they are reading or listening to any mathematical presentation. If they can't come up with the answers themselves, it is an indication they need more work or need to get help from their instructor."<br><br>"The communication exercises are well thought out. They are more than just "state in your own words" type questions. They can make students think more deeply about the ideas and processes and learn to express themselves in the terminology of mathematics."<br><br>"The examples are in general very good. They both illustrate key ideas and then often expand on them leading to more in depth discussions following the example. The follow up "Before we go on..." discussions are excellent and are, to me, along with the Question and Answer format paragraphs, the real highlight and selling point of the text."<br><br>"The exercises are outstanding. There are enough mechanical problems to let the student perfect technique, yet the real strength is the application problems, which by their nature, provide understandable insight into how mathematics permeates modern life. The application problems are quite varied and inherently interesting. Being able to see why a technique is useful is often just the motivation some students need to really try to understand it."</p><h2>Africa&#39;s Gift to America: The Afro-American in the Making and Saving of the United States</h2><p>Originally published in 1959 and revised and expanded in 1989, this book asserts that Africans had contributed more to the world than was previously acknowledged. Historian Joel Augustus Rogers devoted a significant amount of his professional life to unearthing facts about people of African ancestry. He intended these findings to be a refutation of contemporary racist beliefs about the inferiority of blacks. Rogers asserted that the color of skin did not determine intellectual genius, and he publicized the great black civilizations that had flourished in Africa during antiquity. According to Rogers, many ancient African civilizations had been primal molders of Western civilization and culture.</p><p>JOEL AUGUSTUS ROGERS (September 6, 1880&#x2013;;March 26, 1966) was a Jamaican-American author, journalist, and historian who contributed to the history of Africa and the African diaspora, especially the history of African Americans in the United States. His research spanned the academic fields of history, sociology and anthropology. He challenged prevailing ideas about race, demonstrated the connections between civilizations, and traced African achievements. He was one of the greatest popularizers of African history in the twentieth century. Rogers addresses issues such as the lack of scientific support for the idea of race, the lack of black history being told from a black person's perspective, and the fact of intermarriage and unions among peoples throughout history. A respected historian and gifted lecturer, Rogers was a close personal friend of the Harlem-based intellectual and activist Hubert Harrison. In the 1920s, Rogers worked as a journalist on the Pittsburgh Courier and the Chicago Enterprise, and he served as the first black foreign correspondent from the United States.</p><h2>How to Instantly Connect with Anyone: 96 All-New Little Tricks for Big Success in Relationships</h2><p><p>This sequel to Leil&#x2019;s international top selling &#x201c;How to Talk to Anyone&#x201d; makes you a master communicator with 96 all new cutting-edge communication &#x201c;Little Tricks&#x201d; for big success in business and social relationships&#x2015;in person, by email, and on the phone.

Otto Scharmer invites us to see the world in new ways.<p>What we pay attention to, and how we pay attention is the key to what we create. What often prevents us from 'being present, ' is what Scharmer calls our blind spot, the inner place from which each of us operates. Becoming aware of our blind spot is critical to bringing forth the profound systemic changes so needed in business and society today.</p><p>First introduced in Presence, the U methodology of leading profound change is expanded and deepened in Theory U. By moving through the ""U"" process we learn to connect to our essential Self in the realm of 'presencing' - a term coined by Scharmer. When 'presencing' we are able to see our own blind spot and pay attention in a way that allows us to experience the opening of our minds, our hearts, and our wills. Through this process we are able to shift our awareness to allow us to connect with our best future possibility--and to realize it.</p></p><p>Praise for <i>Theory U</i> <p>"Scharmer's <i>Theory U</i> model of how to open our mind, emotions, and will to moments of discovery and mutual understanding is profound and much needed."<br> --Edgar Schein, Sloan Fellows Professor of Management Emeritus, MIT Sloan School of Management, and author of <i>Helping</i> "Pushes the envelope of current leadership wisdom and invites you to explore the strongest leadership tool there is: yourself."<br> --Ralf Schneider, Head of Global Talent Management, PricewaterhouseCoopers "The impact of the <i>Theory U</i> method on our organization is remarkable, but even more important is the amazing personal growth many leaders have experienced. Scharmer's work has allowed them to experience a new approach to the world."<br> --Marcia Marsh, Chief Operating Officer, World Wildlife Fund "Though many agree with Einstein's observation that `problems cannot be resolved at the level of consciousness that created them' the key question remains how to realize such a shift. <i>Theory U</i> offers a unique integral perspective combined with a practical approach to addressing the megaissues facing our world today."<br> --Jack Jacometti, Vice President, Global GTL Development, Shell International Gas Limited "This book is an inspiration. It gives definition to the mystery of the creative process."<br> --Eileen Fisher, President and Chief Creative Officer, Eileen Fisher Inc.</p><b>Access the deepest source of inspiration and vision</b> <p>We live in a time of massive institutional failure, one that requires a new consciousness and a new collective leadership capacity. In this groundbreaking book, Otto Scharmer invites us to see the world in new ways and in so doing discover a revolutionary approach to leadership. </p><p>What we pay attention to and how we pay attention is key to what we create. What prevents us from attending to situations more effectively is that we aren't fully aware of and in touch with the inner place from which attention and intention originate. This is what Scharmer calls our blind spot. By moving through Scharmer's U process, we consciously access the blind spot and learn to connect to our authentic Self--the deepest source of knowledge and inspiration--in the realm of "presencing," a term coined by Scharmer that combines the concepts of presence and sensing. Based on ten years of research and action learning and interviews with over 150 practitioners and thought leaders, <i>Theory U</i> offers a rich diversity of compelling stories and examples and includes dozens of exercises and practices that allow leaders, and entire organizations, to shift awareness, connect with the best future possibility, and gain the ability to realize it.</p></p><h2>A History of American Archaeology</h2><p>Book by Willey, Gordon R., Sabloff, Jeremy A.</p><p></p><h2>True Style: The History and Principles of Classic Menswear</h2><p>From choosing the right pair of eyeglasses to properly coordinating a shirt, tie, and pocket square, getting dressed is an art to be mastered.

In witty, stylish prose, Boyer breezes through classic items and traditions in menswear, detailing the evolution and best uses of fabrics like denim and linen, accoutrements like neckties and eyeglasses, and principles for combining patterns, colors, and textures. He enlightens readers about acceptable circumstances for donning a turtleneck, declaims the evils of wearing dress shoes without socks, and trumpets the virtues of sprezzatura, the artistry of concealing effort beneath a cloak of nonchalance.<br><br>With a gentle yet firm approach to the rules of dressing and an incredible working knowledge of the different items, styles, and principles of menswear, Boyer provides essential wardrobe guidance for the discriminating gentleman, explaining what true style looks like-and why.<br></p><p><b>G.

Given this, it is perhaps surprising that so little time is spent studying, analysing and ethically assessing new technologies. Occasionally, an issue attracts public attention &#x2013; for example, the use of human embryonic stem cells in medical research or the online file sharing of music and movies. However, these are the exceptions. For the most part, each new technology and application is enthusiastically embraced with little critical reflection on how it will impact people's lives or the world. Moreover, when an issue raised by an emerging technology is attended to, the language, concepts and critical perspectives to properly address it are frequently found to be lacking. <br>The aim of this textbook is to introduce students and other readers to the ethical issues associated with a broad array of emerging technologies, as well as to help them develop the analytical skills and perspectives necessary for effectively evaluating novel technologies and applications. The technologies discussed include nanotechnology, synthetic biology, robotics, genetic engineering, human enhancement, geoengineering, cultured meat, virtual reality, information technologies, sex selection, and many more.<br>Key features include:<br>� Comprehensive coverage from thirty six chapters written by leading thinkers in the field<br>� An extensive introduction that presents a framework for analysing the ethical dimensions of emerging technologies<br>� Section overviews and chapter summaries that help students master the book's content<br>� Discussion questions that provoke reflection on the issues discussed in each chapter<br><br><i>Ethics and Emerging Technologies</i> is ideal for undergraduate courses on technology and society and technology and ethics. It is also appropriate for technology-oriented modules in environmental ethics and bioethics, as well as ethics modules in engineering and information technology courses. <br></p><p>Keith Abney, Ethics and Emerging Sciences Group, California Polytechnic State University, USA.

Is one method really better than the other? In this instructional book, author Libbie Hawker explains the benefits and technique of planning a story before you begin to write. She'll show you how to develop a foolproof character arc and plot, how to pace any book for a can't-put-down reading experience, and how to ensure that your stories are complete and satisfying without wasting any time or words. Hawker's outlining technique works no matter what genre you write, and no matter the age of your audience. If you want to improve writing speed, increase your backlist, and ensure a quality book before you even write the first word, this is the how-to book for you. Take off your pants!

The development of interpretive modes of various stripes&#x2015;post-structuralist, Marxian, phenomenological, psychoanalytic, as well as others dissenting or eccentric&#x2015;has given scholars a range of tools for rethinking architecture in relation to other fields and for reasserting architectures general importance in intellectual discourse.</p><p>This anthology presents forty-seven of the primary texts of architecture theory, introducing each with an explication of the concepts and categories necessary for its understanding and evaluation. It also presents twelve documents of projects or events that had major theoretical repercussions for the period. Several of the essays appear here in English for the first time.</p><p><b>Contributors</b><br>Diana Agrest, Stanford Anderson, Archizoom, George Baird, Jennifer Bloomer, Massimo Cacciari, Jean-Louis Cohen, Beatriz Colomina, Alan Colquhoun, Maurice Culot, Jacques Derrida, Ignasi de Sol�-Morales, Peter Eisenman, Robin Evans, Michel Foucault, Kenneth Frampton, Mario Gandelsonas, Frank Gehry, J�rgen Habermas, John Hejduk, Denis Hollier, Bernard Huet, Catherine Ingraham, Fredric Jameson, Charles A.

They hear about &#x201c;grace&#x201d; but struggle to rightly understand it, much less live it.&nbsp; They are taught about God, but their vision of him does not always reflect the full biblical portrait of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. When this happens Christians struggle to know the ways of God and how to joyfully participate in his work.&nbsp;</p><p><em>The God Who Gives </em>provides a compelling vision of Christian faith and life, helping readers discover the uniqueness of the gospel - that God's kingdom comes not by taking, but by giving - God gives Himself!&nbsp; We are invited into the fullness of life that can only come through the gift of God&#x2019;s divine generosity.</p><p>Taking readers through the grand biblical narrative of creation, fall, redemption, and kingdom author Kelly M. Kapic helps us see our story in and through the story of Scripture. He shows that everything belongs to God, and yet because of our turning and taking from him we experience a kind of suffocating bondage to sin. So how does God reclaim us? God gives again. The God who gave in creation restores by recreating us through his Son and by his Spirit. The kingdom of God is an overflowing measure of divine generosity that we are invited to participate in.</p><p><em>The God Who Gives</em>&nbsp;calls readers to discover that the whole Christian story is founded upon the Triune God&#x2019;s self-giving and our belonging to God. Fully embracing this truth changes how we view God, ourselves, and the world. Living in God's gifts, we are freed to give ourselves and truly experience life.</p></p><p><p>Kelly M.

Even with a knowledge of best practices, it's a challenge to plan instruction that meets the needs of all our students. <i>How to Plan Differentiated Reading Instruction</i> is a comprehensive resource that clarifies the planning process and shows teachers how to use assessments to plan for differentiated instruction."--Jennifer Allen, MEd, literacy specialist, Waterville (Maine) Public Schools</p>"Walpole and McKenna have expertly responded to concerns of educators from the field to create this indispensable guide. Teachers will be refreshed by its user-friendly, common-sense approach. The strength of the book lies in its power to 'unpack' the authors&#x2019; thinking about lesson planning, thus serving as a practical springboard for teachers as they provide for the literacy needs of every student."--Sonia Q. Cabell, MEd, research staff, Preschool Language and Literacy Lab, University of Virginia; former second-grade teacher and reading coach<br><br>"Based on their extensive experience in the design of early reading instruction and in professional development, Walpole and McKenna explain how to organize reading instruction in the primary grades to provide grade-level instruction in vocabulary and comprehension together with differentiated instruction in word recognition and fluency. To make this system work, teachers need systematic routines for word recognition instruction, and the book provides those routines with clear explanations. The book is a terrific resource in my literacy course focused on children with special needs; my students implement the lessons in the field as tier 2 instruction."--Charles A.

In <i>The Priority of Christ</i>, Bishop Robert Barron shows that the answer to this debate--and the way to move forward--lies in Jesus. Barron transcends the usual liberal/conservative or Protestant/Catholic divides with a postliberal Catholicism that brings the focus back on Jesus as revealed in the New Testament narratives. <br><br>Barron's classical Catholic post-liberalism will be of interest to a broad audience including not only the academic community but also preachers and general readers interested in entering the dialogue between Catholicism and postliberalism.</p><p>"It is crucial for Christians to apprehend the implications of Robert Barron's trenchant thesis: 'Modernity and decadent Christianity are enemies in one sense, but in another sense, they are deeply connected to one another and mirror one another.' Moving beyond the 'decadent Christianity' that mistakenly sought its very starting points in the epistemological and metaphysical dead ends characteristic of 'modernity,' Barron expertly weaves together a robust short<i>summa</i>.

Rosengarten</b>, University of Chicago <br><i><br></i>"An extremely well-written, informative, and insightful text that would be a delight to use in an undergraduate or seminary classroom."<br>--<b>Stephen H. Webb</b>, <i>Reviews in Religion &amp; Theology<br><br></i>"Barron's project is impressively traditional and thus postmodern, aggressively independent and thus postliberal, and philosophically undistracted and thus properly theological. This book brings together many of the motifs of a re-emergent, unembarrassed, and confident Catholic theology."<br>--<b>Daniel P. Sheridan</b>, CatholicBooksReview.org<br><i><br></i>"<i>The Priority of Christ</i> is unusually stimulating for an exercise in 'postliberal' theology. The book is strikingly readable and saturated with what one might call 'first-order' doctrinal claims instead of primarily methodological navel-gazing.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Its title, 'The Priority of Christ,' indicates the epistemic primacy of believing, doctrinally traditioned engagement with the Jesus Christ of biblical narrative. This scriptural primacy is a great strength and delight of the book.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [It] will challenge readers to formulate their own understanding of what constitutes authentically theological interpretation of Scripture."<br>--<b>Daniel J. Treier</b>, <i>Modern Theology</i>"By displaying how an imaginative human spirit can be illuminated by the manifold sense of Scripture, and by activating tradition to dissolve lingering philosophical distractions, this stunning <i>summa</i> for a 'postliberal Catholicism' will at once subvert any tendency among the faithful to demand a facile 'fix,' as well as offer lucid direction for anyone daring to undertake a pilgrimage of understanding--in and with the Christ."<br>--<b>David B. Burrell</b>, University of Notre Dame / Tantur Ecumenical Institute (Jerusalem)<br><br>"Drawing deftly on Aquinas, Newman, Lonergan, Balthasar, and many others, Barron convincingly explains what a postliberal Catholic theology might be. But the great merit of this book is that he not only talks about what theology should be, he actually does it--above all in his lucid mystagogy on a series of Gospel stories and in striking meditations on the mind of Christ embodied in four great women saints of our time."<br>--<b>Bruce Marshall</b>, Southern Methodist University<br><br>"It is crucial for Christians to apprehend the implications of Robert Barron's trenchant thesis: 'Modernity and decadent Christianity are enemies in one sense, but in another sense, they are deeply connected to one another and mirror one another.'

Paintings from Hassam's Isles of Shoals series are among the most familiar icons of late nineteenth-century American art. But until now, a comprehensive selection of these beautiful works had not been collected in one place. David Park Curry's informative text provides the background essential to a full appreciation of these works. 105 full-color reproductions and100 black-and-white photographs.</p><p>David Park Curry is a distinguished curator and scholar of American art. He is the senior curator of decorative arts, American painting, and sculpture at the Baltimore Museum of Art. In addition, Curry has served as curator at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, the Denver Art Museum, and the Freer Gallery of Art.In 1894, writer Celia Thaxter published An Island Garden describing her rambling cottage garden at Appledore, on the rocky Isles of Shoals, ten miles off the New Hampshire coast. American Impressionist Childe Hassam (1859-1935) illustrated her book. As a frequent visitor to the Shoals, Hassam created a series of oils, watercolors, and pastels capturing their idyllic serenity. For the first time, Curry has assembled an exhibition of many of the Shoals paintings and has written this catalog to "record not only the beauty of a poet's garden in its glory, but also the flowering of a young artist's dreams." The text provides welcome material where little exists, and the brilliant color plates evoke Hassam's aesthetic philosophy.

It documents, entry by entry, the fate and historic distortion of matriarchal religion by triumphant patriarchy in the last few thousand years and makes sense of many of the seemingly senseless customs and rationalizations of creeds and beliefs of our major religions and our folkloric traditions. The Los Angeles Times called it a feminist-scholar&#39;s gold mine and a browser&#39;s delight. The San Francisco Chronicle called the book a mountain of scholarship, a vast mass of supremely documented material. The praise seems to be well-deserved. This book will encourage you to do independent research into history, anthropology, the pagan religions and other disciplines and the political struggle between the patriarchal religions and the pagan religions.</p><p></p><h2>Quicksand</h2><p>2011 Reprint of 1928 Edition not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. Nella Larsen&#39;s first novel tells the story of Helga Crane, a fictional character loosely based on Larsen&#39;s own early life. Crane is the lovely and refined daughter of a Danish mother and a West Indian black father who abandons Helga and her mother soon after Helga is born. Unable to feel comfortable with any of her white-skinned relatives, Helga lives in various places in America and visits Denmark in search of people among whom she feels at home. The work is a superb psychological study of a complicated and appealing woman, Helga Crane, who, like Larsen herself, is the product of a liaison between a black man and a white woman. In one sense, Quicksand might be called an odyssey; however, instead of overcoming a series of obstacles and finally arriving at her native land, Larsen&#39;s protagonist has a series of adventures, each of which ends in disappointment.</p><p>One of the shining stars of the Harlem Renaissance, Nellallitea "Nella" Larsen (April 13, 1891&#x2013;March 30, 1964) left behind only two novels and a handful of short stories &#x2014; but Larsen's remarkable voice and vision has ensured her place in literary history."Fine, thoughtful and courageous.

His cravings take him to Paris at age eighteen to try his hand at art, then back to London to study medicine. But even so, nothing can sate his nagging hunger for experience. Then he falls obsessively in love, embarking on a disastrous relationship that will change his life forever....<br><br>Marked by countless similarities to Maugham&#x2019;s own life, his masterpiece is &#x201c;not an autobiography,&#x201d; as the author himself once contended, &#x201c;but an autobiographical novel; fact and fiction are inexorably mingled; the emotions are my own.&#x201d; And although he based <i>Of Human Bondage</i> on what he knew, his is an &#x201c;excessively rare gift of storytelling...almost the equal of imagination itself.&#x201d;*<br><br>With an Introduction by Benjamin De Mott and an Afterword by Maeve Binchy<br><br>*<i>The Sunday Times </i>(London)</p><p>It is very difficult for a writer of my generation, if he is honest, to pretend indifference to the work of Somerset Maugham," wrote Gore Vidal. "He was always so entirely there."<br> Originally published in 1915, Of Human Bondage is a potent expression of the power of sexual obsession and of modern man's yearning for freedom. This classic bildungsroman tells the story of Philip Carey, a sensitive boy born with a clubfoot who is orphaned and raised by a religious aunt and uncle. Philip yearns for adventure, and at eighteen leaves home, eventually pursuing a career as an artist in Paris. When he returns to London to study medicine, he meets the androgynous but alluring Mildred and begins a doomed love affair that will change the course of his life. There is no more powerful story of sexual infatuation, of human longing for connection and freedom.<br> "Here is a novel of the utmost importance," wrote Theodore Dreiser on publication.

In this text, grammar is treated as a tool for developing the ability to communicate in Japanese, rather than as a focal point. The rich illustration program--including photographs, line drawings, and realia--provides an attractive context for language learning.</p><p></p><h2>Developing Person Through the Life Span, Paper Version</h2><p>With Kathleen Stassen Berger&#39;s always contemporary, always compelling textbook, students learn to see how the basic ideas of developmental psychology apply to their own lives, the lives of those around them, and the lives of others of all life stages and in cultures all around the world.

The taxonomic evidence described includes data from morphology, anatomy, embryology, chromosomes, palynology, secondary plant compounds, proteins, and DNA. Molecular taxonomic methods are fully presented, as are the results of many recent studies, both molecular and morphological. A chapter on the history of plant classification puts current systematic methods into historical context. Issues relating to variation in plant populations and species, including speciation and species concepts, polyploidy, hybridization, breeding systems, and introgression are carefully considered. Appendices cover botanical nomenclature as well as field and herbarium methodology. The text is copiously illustrated, using in large part the informative analytical drawings developed as part of the Generic Flora of the Southeastern United States project.</p><p>WALTER S.

Interviews with the artists take you inside the creative process that turns simple, plastic bricks into remarkable LEGO masterpieces.</p><p><b>Mike Doyle</b> is an internationally acclaimed LEGO artist and known for his stunningly realistic, grand-scale designs. His award-winning <i>Abandoned House</i> series has been showcased at Gallery1988 in LA and Boston&#x2019;s Museum of Realist Art. His largest piece to date is <i>Contact I</i>&#x2014;a 6�6-foot masterwork built from more than 200,000 LEGO elements. When not constructing LEGO art, Doyle works as a graphic designer. He lives with his wife and two children in New Jersey.Legos have been a building block of childhoods around the world for decades (the Danish company, the Lego Group, was founded in 1949), but as graphic designer Doyle demonstrates in this impressive collection of 360 Lego models, they&#39;re far from child&#39;s play. The book showcases the work of 77 artists, who offer a wildly divergent results: from portraits of Freddie Mercury and the monsters from Alien to dissected frogs, space stations, and chromed-out hot rods. Though Doyle humbly waits until the middle of the book to showcase a few of his own sculptures, they are among the most striking. His stark black-and-white renderings of an elegant Victorian house damaged by an uprooted tree, as well as the book&#39;s cover (a massive futuristic city with countless spires) are nothing short of breathtaking. Brief bios of the creators accompany each entry, with the artists discussing what drew them to Lego bricks and their approach to design. One featured artist, Jordan Schwartz, may have achieved the ultimate goal: landing a job at Lego as a product designer due in part to his creations. Surprisingly, the book doesn&#39;t include specifications such as the dimensions of the pieces or the number of bricks used, nor are there images of works-in-progress. If readers can forgive that, they will be mesmerized by this astonishing collection. Full-color illus.

Topics include Canon of Scripture: the list of all books that belong in the Bible; Authority of Scripture: all words in Scripture are God&#x2019;s words because that is what the Bible claims for itself; Clarity of Scripture: the Bible is written so that its teachings are able to be understood by all who read it; Necessity of Scripture: the Bible is necessary for knowledge of the gospel; and Sufficiency of Scripture: Scripture contains all the words of God he intended his people to have. Written in a friendly tone, appealing to the emotions and the spirit as well as the intellect, Making Sense of the Bible helps readers overcome wrong ideas, make better decisions on new questions, and grow as Christians.</p></p><p><p>Wayne Grudem is research professor of Theology and Biblical Studies at Phoenix Seminary in Phoenix, Arizona.

"Civilization and fever and all the morbidness that has been hooted at me has not dimmed my glacial eye, and I care to live only to entice people to look at Nature's loveliness. My own special self is nothing."<br><br>In Donald Worster's magisterial biography, John Muir's "special self" is fully explored as is his extraordinary ability, then and now, to get others to see the sacred beauty of the natural world. <em>A Passion for Nature</em> is the most complete account of the great conservationist and founder of the Sierra Club ever written. It is the first to be based on Muir's full private correspondence and to meet modern scholarly standards. Yet it is also full of rich detail and personal anecdote, uncovering the complex inner life behind the legend of the solitary mountain man. It traces Muir from his boyhood in Scotland and frontier Wisconsin to his adult life in California right after the Civil War up to his death on the eve of World War I. It explores his marriage and family life, his relationship with his abusive father, his many friendships with the humble and famous (including Theodore Roosevelt and Ralph Waldo Emerson), and his role in founding the modern American conservation movement. Inspired by Muir's passion for the wilderness, Americans created a long and stunning list of national parks and wilderness areas, Yosemite most prominent among them. Yet the book also describes a Muir who was a successful fruit-grower, a talented scientist and world-traveler, a doting father and husband, a self-made man of wealth and political influence. A man for whom mountaineering was "a pathway to revelation and worship."<br><br>For anyone wishing to more fully understand America's first great environmentalist, and the enormous influence he still exerts today, Donald Worster's biography offers a wealth of insight into the passionate nature of a man whose passion for nature remains unsurpassed.<br></p><p><br><strong>Donald Worster</strong> is Hall Distinguished Professor of American History, University of Kansas and the author of many books, including <em>A River Running West</em> (OUP 2000); <em>The Wealth of Nature: Environmental History and the Ecological Imagination</em> (OUP 1993); and <em>Under Western Skies: Nature and History in the</em> <em>American West</em> (OUP 1993),<br><br>"The record of Muir's life that Worster has scrupulously assembled, fascinating in its own right, takes on added significance as Worster sets it in context."--<em>New York Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"A wonderful book that celebrates Muir's life and legacy."--<em>San Francisco Chronicle</em><p></p><br>"An excellent new biography of John Muir..."--<em>New York Review of Books</em><p></p><br>"To write this excellent biography of John Muir, Donald Worster zealously ransacked the letters and journals of the great, self-taught naturalist.... This well-written biography reveals a man whose mission in life was simply to entice people to see Nature's loveliness."--<em>True West</em><p></p><br>"With this splendid biography, Donald Worster...reminds us of the debt we owe John Muir... Mr. Worster's meticulous research and fluid writing style make <em>A Passion for Nature</em> a model of biography."--<em>Dallas Morning News</em><p></p><br>"John Muir's battles to preserve the Sierra Nevada and Yosemite Park, his founding of the Sierra Club, his final, bitter, unsuccessful effort to save Hetch Hetchy Valley, his pioneering insights into the geology of the glacial age, and his late Victorian combination of religion and pantheism have been extensively chronicled. What is unique about <em>A Passion for Nature</em> is the skill with which Worster places Muir in a political context. Worster helps us understand how the love of nature is related to other social movements for equality, that human indifference to the natural world is morally an example of the oppressive hierarchies that mar our history." --Carl Pope, Executive Director, Sierra Club<p></p><br>"Donald Worster's <em>A Passion for Nature: The Life of John Muir</em> is an engagingly written, adroitly balanced appraisal that places its subject within the emerging environmental consciousness of the late 19th century. Drawing on a host of letters and journals, Worster, a highly regarded historian of environmental movements, composes a complete and completely appealing picture of a more complicated man than we thought we knew."--<em>Boston Globe</em><p></p><br>"A towering biography of a towering figure! John Muir is one of those very few Americans who reshaped the way we saw the world. This volume, from one of our most eminent historians, makes clear both the sources and the meaning of Muir's great and wild epiphany." --Bill McKibben, author of <em>The Bill</em> <em>McKibben Reader</em><p></p><br>"...this marvelously fluent portrait of the man who sought to establish 'an ethic of environmental restraint' a century ago and whose powerful arguments still hold."--<em>Booklist</em><p></p><br>"Competently documented, this all-inclusive biography explains the life and times of a figure known to all who love nature and will appeal to general readers and anyone interested in the early roots of today's green movement and its founding fathers."--<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"Reading Donald Worster's superb new biography...is as close as history will ever get to understanding what made the multidimensional Sierra Club founder tick. Yosemite's great bard bursts through Worster's fine prose in all his cosmic grace and preservationist pluck."--Douglas Brinkley, <em>Los Angeles</em> <em>Times</em><p></p><br>"Comprehensive, measured, deeply sympathetic and well balanced, it is nevertheless provocative, and a great read to boot."--<em>San Francisco Chronicle Review</em><p></p><br>"A magnificent account of one of the principal leaders of the environmental movement in America. This is an engaging and eautifully written story that illumines the broader sources and challenges of Muir's passion for nature." --Mary Evelyn Tucker, Yale University<p></p><br>"As far as the American environment is concerned, few figures have wielded more influence than John Muir. How appropriate, then, that one of Americas most noted environmental historians, Donald Worster, should now present John Muir in all his complexity and achievement in this authoritative and lively biography." --Kevin Starr, University of Southern California<p></p><br>"<em>A Passion for Nature</em> is an excellent, readable, engaging piece of scholarship that should now be considered the definitive biography of one of America's most influential advocates for nature."--<em>American Scientist</em><p></p><br>"America has had no more passionate defender of wild nature than John Muir, and there is no more passionate chronicler of the nations environmental past than Donald Worster. We are lucky that so insightful and eloquent a scholar has now produced a biography of Muir that will surely be regarded as a benchmark for many years to come." --William Cronon, University of Wisconsin-Madison<p></p><br>"Worster's comprehensive biography of our state's first naturalist spends as much energy on reconstructing Muir's emotional life as in recording dates and details. Given the importance of Muir both to California and to conservation, its a worthy topic."--<em>Sacramento News &amp; Review</em><p></p><br>"In <em>A Passion for Nature</em>, Donald Worster provides a beautifully crafted, richly detailed, and sophisticated biography of Muir."--<em>Reviews in American History</em><p></p><br>"Donald Worster is a widely acclaimed environmental historian.

" -- Aaron Sachs, <em>American Historical Review</em> <br><p></p><br>"A Passion for Nature supplants all earlier Muir biographies and will undoubtedly stand the test of time for its sophisticated interpretations and impressive narrative power. Worster manages to breathe life into the well-worn Muir story, a tribute to his considerable skill as a writer and historian. This book is a pleasure to read."--<em>Journal of American History</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>The Mongols (The Peoples of Europe)</h2><p>The Mongol Empire was the largest continuous land empire known to history, its violent creation the major political event of the 13th century world. Yet little is known of the history of Christendom&#39;s most formidable and dangerous eastern neighbour. This chronicle benefits from new discoveries and a broad range of source material. David Morgan explains how the vast Mongolian Empire was organized and governed, examining the religious and political character of the steppe nomadic society. He assesses the astonishing military career of Chingiz (Genghis) Khan, considers the nature of Mongol imperial government, and the effects of Mongol campaigns on the countries and peoples they conquered in China, Russia, Persia and Europe.

Terry</p><h2>A Blind Man Can See How Much I Love You: Stories</h2><p>"Amy Bloom gets more meaning into individual sentences than most authors manage in whole books."<br><br>--<i>The New Yorker</i><br>A great short story has the emotional depth and intensity of a poem and the wholeness and breadth of a novel. Amy Bloom writes great short stories. Her first collection, <i>Come to Me</i>, was a finalist for the National Book Award, and here she deepens and extends her mastery of the form.<br> <br>Real people inhabit these pages, the people we know and are, the people we long to be and are afraid to be: a mother and her brave, smart little girl, each coming to terms with the looming knowledge that the little girl will become a man; a wildly unreliable narrator bent on convincing us that her stories are not harmless; a woman with breast cancer, a frightened husband, and a best friend, all discovering that their lifelong triangle is not what they imagined; a man and his stepmother engaged in a complicated dance of memory, anger, and forgiveness. Amy Bloom takes us straight to the center of these lives with rare generosity and sublime wit, in flawless prose that is by turns sensuous, spare, heartbreaking, and laugh-out-loud funny.<br> <br>These are transcendent stories: about the uncertain gestures of love, about the betrayals and gifts of the body, about the surprises and bounties of the heart, and about what comes to us unbidden and what we choose.</p><p>It was Henry James who first claimed the imagination of disaster, but in Amy Bloom's stunning second collection, she appears to have inherited the mantle. Most of the characters in <i>A Blind Man Can See How Much I Love You</i> are pursued by at least one of the biological furies: cancer, miscarriage, Parkinson's disease. And even those with their health intact tend to be sick at heart, having run the gantlet of family life and suffered what the military men like to call friendly fire. Yet the effect of these brilliant stories is anything but dreary. Instead they produce an odd sense of elation--Bloom somehow persuades us that her characters will continue under their own steam long after we've closed the book, and she alternates hope and hopelessness in exactly the right, recognizable proportions.<p> Take the title story, in which a middle-aged mother is determined to see her daughter through the rigors of a sex-change operation. Jane puts up a good front, almost but not quite earning the title of Transsexual Mom of the Year, and supports her "handsome boy-girl" every step of the way. Yet the strain shows. And when she meets a supernaturally nice man, she can't quite credit her good fortune--even his appearance at her door with an armload of flowers touches off a fresh round of ambivalence: </p><blockquote> And standing on the little porch of the condo, barely enough room for two medium-size people and forty-eight roses, Jane sees that she has taken her place in the long and honorable line of fools for love: Don Quixote and Hermia and Oscar Wilde and Joe E. Brown, crowing with delight, clutching his straw boater and Jack Lemmon as the speedboat carries them off into a cockeyed and irresistible future. </blockquote> The inclusion of <i>Some Like It Hot</i>'s Joe E. Brown, who's gotten both more and less than he bargained for in his cross-dressing sweetheart, is a typically marvelous touch. And lest we think that Bloom has weighted the scales too heavily in favor of disillusion, Jane's new lover gets in the last word, citing the South Carolina state motto: "<i>Dum spiro, spero</i>.... While I breathe, I hope." Just keep breathing, the reader wants to say.<p> "Stars at Elbow and Foot" and "Rowing to Eden" are no less effective in their mingling of tragedy and sublime trivia. In two other stories, Bloom revives the Sampson clan, which she first introduced in <i>Come to Me</i>, and beautifully extends her mini-epic of mixed-race life without a grain of namby-pamby PC hesitation. And last but not least, there's "The Story," a tricky number in which Bloom seems to shoot to hell her own reputation for Chekhovian decency. Here we have a narrator who lies and dissembles, destroys her rival, and lives to tell the (metafictional) tale: "Even now I regard her destruction as a very good thing, and that undermines the necessary fictive texture of deep ambiguity, the roiling ambivalence that might give tension to the narrator's affection." In the end, though, Bloom is simply too gifted a writer to banish all seven types of ambiguity from her work. She understands that we are hopelessly divided creatures and cuts us the necessary, unsentimental slack. Or to put it another way, she forgives all--but forgets nothing. <i>--James Marcus</i></p><br>"Amy Bloom's work takes ordinary lives under examination and discovers the strange elements that render no life ordinary. Her characters and situations give the sense of things happening for the first time to inimitable individuals."<p><br><br>---Robert Stone<br>"Amy Bloom is possessed of great subtlety and rock-solid integrity. Her stories crackle with subvert revelation. She is a compassionate writer who, more important, loves the world too much to sentimentalize it."</p><p><br><br> ---Michael Cunningham<br>"Amy Bloom's masterful stories take place at the point where love and desire collide with convention. At once achingly funny and heartbreaking, these stories live on long past the print and the page."</p><p><br> <br>---Jane Hamilton<br></p></p><h2>Focus on Earth Science California Edition (California Science Explorer)</h2><p>Will be shipped from US.

In these first two books Aristotle shows his complete mastery of political theory and practice, and raises many crucial issues still with us today. In Book I he argues vigorously for a political theory based on &#39;nature&#39;. By nature, man is a &#39;political animal&#39;, one naturally fitted for life in a polis or state. Some people, however, are natural slaves; and women are by nature subordinate to men. Acquisition and exchange are natural, but not trading for profit. In Book II he launches a sharp attack on Plato&#39;s two &#39;utopias&#39;, the Republic and the Laws, and also criticizes three historical states reputed to be well governed: Sparta, Crete, and Carthage. This volume contains a close translation of these two books, together with a philosophical commentary. It is well suited to the requirements of readers who do not know Greek.</p><p>Aristotle&#39;s Politics, along with Plato&#39;s Republic, constitutes the fountainhead of social and political theory. Sir Ernest Barker, in his Preface to this edition, describes the kind of translation which he feels is needed by the English-speaking-world.Aristotle was an ancient Greek philosopher, a student of Plato and teacher of Alexander the Great.</p><h2>Fundamentals of Audiology for the Speech-Language Pathologist</h2><p>Each new print copy includes Navigate 2 Advantage Access that unlocks a comprehensive and interactive eBook, animations, student practice activities and assessments, a full suite of instructor resources, and learning analytics reporting tools.<br><br>Fundamentals of Audiology for the Speech-Language Pathologist, Second Edition is specifically written to provide the speech language pathologist with a knowledge base to work with individuals who are hard of hearing, deaf and diagnosed with (central) auditory processing disorder.

Div. degree from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in 1960, and his Ph.D. in Old Testament studies from Boston University in 1965. Dr. Hopfe began his teaching career in 1965 as an instructor in religious studies at Kendall College, Evanston, Illinois. During his early years of teaching it became apparent that there was a need for an introductory textbook for the study of world religions. He said, &#x201c;Religion is never a simple subject, and can become complex and intricate to the complete dismay of the beginning student.&#x201d; His goal was to provide the student with a reasonably brief and readable text that did not shortcut or simplify religions, but did not delve too deeply into the technicalities. Responding to this need the first edition of Religions of the World became a reality and was published in 1979. Dr. Hopfe was &#x201c;an author, teacher, pastor, archaeologist, college dean, weight lifter, and spiritual guide to students, colleagues, and parishioners&#x201d; whose lives he touched via the written and spoken word. <i>Religions of the World</i> is his legacy to academia.<br> <br> <b>Mark R.

Cacioppo unveils his pioneering research on the startling effects of loneliness: a sense of isolation or social rejection disrupts not only our thinking abilities and will power but also our immune systems, and can be as damaging as obesity or smoking. A blend of biological and social science, this book demonstrates that, as individuals and as a society, we have everything to gain, and everything to lose, in how well or how poorly we manage our need for social bonds.</p> 12 illustrations</p><p><p><strong>John T. Cacioppo</strong> (1951&#x2015;2018) was a psychology professor at the University of Chicago and director of the university&#x2019;s Center for Cognitive and Social Neuroscience. He was the author of more than a dozen books, including <em>Loneliness: Human Nature and the Need for Social Connections</em>.</p><p><strong>William Patrick</strong>, former editor for science and medicine at Harvard University Press, is editor in chief of the <em>Journal of Life Sciences</em>. He lives in Ipswich, Massachusetts.<br></p>Eleanor Rigby might have been in worse shape than the Beatles imagined: not only lonely but angry, depressed and in ill health. University of Chicago research psychologist Cacioppo shows in studies that loneliness can be harmful to our overall well-being. Loneliness, he says, impairs the ability to feel trust and affection, and people who lack emotional intimacy are less able to exercise good judgment in socially ambiguous situations; this makes them more vulnerable to bullying as children and exploitation by unscrupulous salespeople in old age. But Cacioppo and Patrick (editor of the <i>Journal of Life Sciences</i>) want primarily to apply evolutionary psychology to explain how our brains have become hard-wired to have regular contact with others to aid survival. So intense is the need to connect, say the authors, that isolated individuals sometimes form parasocial relations with pets or TV characters. The authors' advice for dealing with loneliness&#x2014;psychotherapy, positive thinking, random acts of kindness&#x2014;are overly general, but this isn't a self-help book. It does present a solid scientific look at the physical and emotional impact of loneliness. 12 illus. <i>(Aug. 25)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

For practical applications, the Student Assignments at the end of the chapter provide you with relevant and interesting projects to complete that deal with the various areas of the law. ORGANIZATION OF EACH CHAPTER </p><p> The text follows a logical organization, with chapters building on each other and prior chapters. Each chapter provides an excellent learning experience and is organized as follows:</p><p>Objectives Chapter text Summary Vocabulary Student Assessment Student Assignments </p><p> Objectives are listed at the beginning of each chapter that identify the material to be covered in that chapter. The chapter text reflects this organization and presents the material in an orderly manner. The summary reviews the material presented in the chapter, and the vocabulary provides definitions for the words highlighted in the chapter. The student assessment provides questions that evaluate the learning process and reinforce the student's understanding of the topic covered. The student assignments provide relevant and interesting learning activities that have been taken from a sample law office. ORGANIZATION OF THE TEXT </p><p> The sixteen chapters are organized into six main parts: </p><p> Part 1: The Law Office<br> Chapter 1 provides a background of the law office and those persons involved in its operation. Chapter 2 provides an overview of the duties required of the legal support staff. Chapter 3 provides information on the dramatic changes that have occurred in the law office as a result of advances in technology, software, and telecommunications. Chapter 4 discusses the preparation and formatting of legal correspondence. </p><p> Part 2: General Information<br> This section focuses on the history of the law in Chapter 5, providing some background on our present legal system, and Chapter 6 discusses the court structure and its influence on the legal environment. </p><p> Part 3: Litigation Procedures<br> Chapters 7, 8, and 9 deal with preparing legal documents and the procedures involved in the litigation process. This section covers the preparation of pleadings and other court papers used in civil matters, from the initial filing of a lawsuit through discovery, trial, and the appellate procedures. </p><p> Part 4: Substantive Law<br> Part 4 (Chapters 10 through 14) describes the other areas of the law, such as family; wills, trusts, and probate; business organizations; real estate; and criminal law. These chapters focus on increasing your knowledge of the law while providing activities that improve document processing skills and understanding of the procedural sequence. Actual legal cases that have been adapted into practice sets provide realistic training in these areas of the law. </p><p> Part 5: Legal Research<br> Chapter 15 provides information on the U.S. legal system and the sources for doing legal research. Activities provided at the end of the chapter make use of Internet search procedures that relate to the legal field. </p><p> Part 6: Getting a Job<br> Chapter 16 helps you to assess your strengths and weaknesses and outlines a guide to prepare for employment and develop a job search plan to achieve that goal. This chapter discusses sources for employment, suggestions for preparing a resume, the letter of application, and follow-up procedures. FEATURES OF THE BOOK </p><p> This book contains many features that will provide excellent information and training for the law office staff. </p><p> Disk<br> Documents have been recorded on the disk that is located in the pocket in the back of the book. This disk includes legal documents that you are not required to type, and that can be used in the completion of the various projects. Subdirectories have been created on the disk for Microsoft WORD 97 and WordPerfect for Windows. Files that have been created in Microsoft WORD are stored in the WORD subdirectory, and files that have been created in WordPerfect for Windows are stored in the WP directory. These documents can be easily converted to other software programs used by most schools. </p><p> As you complete the projects, you are instructed to keyboard changes to the documents saved on the student's disk or create a new document, print a hard copy for the instructor, and save a copy to your disk. Simulation activities are presented for most chapters, that enables you to prepare documents in a "real life" office scenario using the legal skills for the document preparation in the chapter. </p><p> If a student's disk is damaged, a copy can be made from the instructor's disk or disks can be downloaded from the Prentice Hall Web Site at prenhall. </p><p> Use the search feature on the homepage to find the listing by title, Legal Office Procedures, Fifth Edition, or by author Joyce Morton, to find the link to download the information for the student data disk. </p><p> Practice Sets<br> The practice sets at the end of selected chapters are prepared in conjunction with the text and provide you with practical experience in performing the actual work involved in preparing a client's case. These projects provide you with information relating to various areas of the law, as well as the manner and sequence in which these papers are prepared.</p><p>Personal Injury Adoption (Independent) Probate (Testate) Corporation Unlawful Detainer (Eviction of a Tenant) Criminal Law </p><p> The practice sets are actual court cases in which the names, dates, and circumstances of the cases have been changed somewhat to make them suitable for student use. Cases have been selected from areas of the law that would most frequently occur in the law office and with which the legal office support staff would most often come into contact. </p><p> Internet Legal Research<br> The legal research chapter contains end-of-chapter projects that require you to use the search engines of the Internet to find information relating to the law. With the many advances taking place in technology, you will find this to be an interesting and relevant exercise. </p><p> Illustrations<br> The book contains illustrations of legal forms relating to each section of the law. They are presented in the sequence in which they would be used in the preparation of the case. While it is impossible to include all the forms, a good sample has been selected to represent the various areas of the law and the procedures covered by each chapter. </p><p> Photographs<br> Many of the law office pictures included in this book were taken at the Graham &amp; James law firm in Costa Mesa, California. The models in the pictures are attorneys, legal office administrators, and the legal support staff. Some of the staff members are former students of the author who have made careers in the legal field. Special acknowledgment should be to given to this staff for allowing us to provide the text with pictures of actual law office situations. </p><p> Instructor's Manual<br> This manual provides teaching suggestions as well as the answers to the Student Assessments (Chapter Tests) and a final exam. Hard copy samples of the hands-on Student Assignments (Projects) are also included. RELEVANT LEARNING EXPERIENCES </p><p> The materials presented in this book have been designed to provide you with relevant and interesting learning experiences on the most current materials available. You must understand, however, that legal procedures, filing fees, and the format of documents and their captions and headings will vary from state to state and jurisdiction to jurisdiction. You should be able to adapt to the procedures used and preferred by your particular office. Also, legal procedures and laws change regularly, and it is important that you and your attorney stay abreast of these constant changes. </p><p> While this book will give you the necessary background to work as a law office support trainee, each area of the law is vast and complex. It is impossible to cover every case or procedure that you may encounter in a law office, and it is this variety that makes legal work so interesting. After completing this book, you may find that certain areas of the law are particularly attractive to you, and these may be the areas in which you will want to specialize. You may obtain this specialization through employment and experience, or you may want to obtain additional training and education. SUMMARY </p><p> This book introduces you to the career of a legal office assistant. It presents basic legal concepts and the various fields of law and outlines the preparation of documents commonly used in these fields. After completing this book, you should be able to select documents appropriate for a particular situation, identify the information necessary to complete the documents, and prepare the documents correctly.

Now, in his first book, Mitchell brings a utopian hopefulness to his images of African Americans, both famous and not. Vibrant, candy-hued palettes and glowing natural light are the hallmark of Mitchell's work. His subjects appear mostly outdoors, in idyllic natural settings or on gritty urban streets. Among the photos presented in the book are those he shot in Cuba, where he traveled to document Havana's emerging skateboard scene, as well as collaborations with Marc Jacobs, American Eagle, and Converse. A sought-after portraitist, his subjects include Amandla Stenberg, Ashton Sanders, Aweng Chuol, KiKi Layne, and Stephan James. In speaking of his work, Mitchell cites an "affirmation in blackness and a unifying visual text of hope." This joyful collection is evidence that Mitchell is well on his way to accomplishing all that and more.</p><p>TYLER MITCHELL is a photographer and filmmaker based in Brooklyn, New York. His photography has been published in <i>Vogue, Dazed, Teen Vogue</i>, and <i>i-D Magazine</i>.

In his first major book of nonfiction since <i>In an Antique Land</i>, Ghosh examines our inability&#x2014;at the level of literature, history, and politics&#x2014;to grasp the scale and violence of climate change.<br><br> The extreme nature of today&#x2019;s climate events, Ghosh asserts, make them peculiarly resistant to contemporary modes of thinking and imagining. This is particularly true of serious literary fiction: hundred-year storms and freakish tornadoes simply feel too improbable for the novel; they are automatically consigned to other genres. In the writing of history, too, the climate crisis has sometimes led to gross simplifications; Ghosh shows that the history of the carbon economy is a tangled global story with many contradictory and counterintuitive elements.<br><br> Ghosh ends by suggesting that politics, much like literature, has become a matter of personal moral reckoning rather than an arena of collective action. But to limit fiction and politics to individual moral adventure comes at a great cost. The climate crisis asks us to imagine other forms of human existence&#x2014;a task to which fiction, Ghosh argues, is the best suited of all cultural forms. His book serves as a great writer&#x2019;s summons to confront the most urgent task of our time.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Amitav Ghosh</b> is an award-winning novelist and essayist whose books include <i>The Circle of Reason</i>, <i>The Shadow Lines</i>,&nbsp;<i>In An Antique Land</i>,&nbsp;<i>Dancing in Cambodia</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Calcutta Chromosome</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Glass Palace</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Hungry Tide</i>,&nbsp;and the Ibis Trilogy: <i>Sea&nbsp;of Poppies</i>, <i>River of Smoke</i>, and&nbsp; <i>Flood of Fire.</i>&#x201c;Ghosh, who has previously broached environmental questions in fiction (<i>The Hungry</i> <i>Tide</i>, the <i>Ibis </i>trilogy, and elsewhere), here steps back from the role of storyteller to analyze modern literature, history, and politics. His purpose is to show that all three cultural modes share assumptions that render climate change unthinkable, occluding our view of its dangers rather than aiding our understanding. . . . To tackle climate change, we would need not only to overcome climate denialism and our reliance on fossil fuels, but also our commitment to moral uplift. The radical restructuring of global power requires more than a good conscience and respect for individuals. From this perspective, the humanities and human sciences confront their greatest challenge armed only with rusting tools forged for another age. &#x2018;The climate crisis is,&#x2019; as Ghosh writes, &#x2018;also a crisis of culture, and thus of the imagination.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (<i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Ghosh is one of the most important living writers writing in English.&#x201d; (<i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;A short but broad-ranging and consistently stimulating indictment of our era of the &#x2018;great derangement.&#x2019; . . .<i> The Great Derangement</i> is a bracing reminder that there is no more vital task for writers and artists than to clear the intellectual dead wood of a vulgarly boosterish age and create space for apocalyptic thinking &#x2013; which may at least delay, if not avert, the catastrophes ahead.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (<i>Guardian</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;In his first work of long-form nonfiction in over 20 years, celebrated novelist Ghosh &#x2018;perhaps the most important question ever to confront <i>culture</i>&#x2019;: how can writers, scholars, and policy makers combat the collective inability to grasp the dangers of today&#x2019;s climate crisis? Ghosh&#x2019;s choice of genre is hardly incidental; among the chief sources of the &#x2018;imaginative and cultural failure that lies at the heart of the climate crisis,&#x2019; he argues, is the resistance of modern linguistic and narrative traditions&#x2014;particularly the 20th-century novel&#x2014;to events so cataclysmic and heretofore improbable that they exceed the purview of serious literary fiction. . . . In this concise and utterly enlightening volume, Ghosh urges the public to find new artistic and political frameworks to understand and reduce the effects of human-caused climate change, sharing his own visionary perspective as a novelist, scholar, and citizen of our imperiled world.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;The exciting and frightening thing about Ghosh&#x2019;s argument is how he traces the novel&#x2019;s narrow compass back to popular and influential scientific ideas&#x2014;ideas that championed uniform and gradual processes over cataclysms and catastrophes. One big complaint about science &#x2014;that it kills wonder&#x2014;is the same criticism Ghosh levels at the novel: that it bequeaths us &#x2018;a world of few surprises, fewer adventures, and no miracles at all.&#x2019; Lawfulness in biology is rather like realism in fiction: it is a convention so useful that we forget that it is a convention. But, if anthropogenic climate change and the gathering sixth mass extinction event have taught us anything, it is that the world is wilder than the laws we are used to would predict. Indeed, if the world really were in a novel&#x2014;or even in a book of popular science&#x2014;no one would believe it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (<i>New Scientist</i>)<br><br><i>&#x201c;The Great Derangement</i> . . . begins with a simple question&#x2014;why have the arts (literature and fiction in particular) been unable and unwilling to grapple with the greatest crisis facing the planet, anthropogenic climate change?&#x2014;and runs in thrillingly unpredictable directions with it.&nbsp; . . . <i>The Great Derangement</i> bristles with trenchant and dense ideas, expressed with exemplary lucidity and finesse. At a time when the idea of the <i>engag�</i> intellectual is not just unfashionable, but in full-blown retreat, here is a book that triumphantly �announces its return.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (<i>New Statesman</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;In this elegant book, Ghosh explains how literary fiction came to avoid depicting the uncanny, the nonhuman, the improbable, and the aggregate. His exploration of the relationship between British imperialism and Asia&#x2019;s carbon economy shows that our constructions of history are as deranged as our literature. In short, we are in denial. . . . Ghosh finds hope in art&#x2019;s tendency to envision possibilities, as well as in the activism of religious communities.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (<i>Christian Century</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Resistance to the grim realities of climate change is so widespread that the crisis barely figures in literary fiction, notes writer Amitav Ghosh. Branding our era of denial and inertia the Great Derangement, Ghosh looks in turn at literature, history and politics to examine this failure, noting that extreme events such as 2012&#x2019;s Hurricane Sandy are so freakish that they seem inexpressible. The solution, he argues, lies in collective action as well as scientific and governmental involvement &#x2014; and in a resurgence in our imaginative capacity to envision human existence anew.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (<i>Nature</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;One of its central themes is that writers, artists and filmmakers, including himself, have largely ignored climate change&#x2014;&#x2018;the great derangement&#x2019; of the title&#x2014; simply because it seems too far-fetched and terrifying. But does it really make a difference if authors write about climate change? &#x2018;Making a difference isn&#x2019;t the point; the point is to examine the meaning of the arts. If we believe that the arts are meant to look ahead, open doors, then how is this huge issue of our time, absent from the arts? It&#x2019;s like death, no one wants to talk about it.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (<i>Guardian</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Ghosh&#x2019;s latest book, <i>The Great Derangement</i>, is a <i>j&#x2019;accuse</i> issued against all those literary writers who abdicated their social responsibility by being indifferent to the climate crisis&#x2014;by far the greatest predicament facing humanity. . . . As <i>The Great Derangement</i> emphasises throughout, the crisis of language is at the heart of every human predicament. And now, if our writers are not leading the way, we&#x2019;re more than doomed.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (<i>Sunday Guardian Live (New Delhi)</i>)</p><h2>The European Dynastic States, 1494-1660 (Short Oxford History of the Modern World)</h2><p>This is a study of Europe during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries--a period of economic and cultural upheaval, of dramatic changes in politics, society, and religion, and of constant warring among the emergent states.

Perrault's tales were enjoyed in the salons of Louis XIV as much as they were loved in the nursery, and it is their wit, humor, and lively detail that capture the imagination of adult and child alike. They transmute into vivid fantasies the hidden fears and conflicts by which children are affected: fears of abandonment, or worse, conflicts with siblings and parents, and the trials of growing up. <br><br>In addition to the familiar stories, this edition also includes the three verse tales--the troubling account of patient <em>Griselda</em>, the comic <em>Three Silly Wishes</em>, and the notorious <em>Donkey-Skin</em>. This translation by Christopher Betts captures the tone and flavor of Perrault's world, and the delightful spirit of the originals.<br></p><p><br><strong>Christopher Betts</strong> was a Senior Lecturer in French at the University of Warwick until retirement. He has translated Montesquieu's <em>Persian Letters</em> for Penguin, and Rousseau's <em>Social Contract</em> and Jean de La Fontaine's <em>Selected Fables</em> for Oxford World's Classics.<br><br>"Betts gives the stories the sense of humour ... The Gustave Dor� illustrations in the Oxford editions add to the baroque feel of the thing as well. These are fairy tales that are as much a pleasure to read now as they were to be told once upon a time ago." - <em>Desperate Reader</em><p></p><br>"It is extraordinary to revisit stories so familiar from childhood and see within their bounds savagery, deceit and dire warnings about predators and even puberty. The hidden symbolism of Perrault's tales is explained in the erudite introduction by Christopher Betts, who has translated the 1697 edition, the only complete translation in both verse and prose. The fairy tale is a rite of passage. Read yours aloud, share it with a small or re-read these tales and wonder at the depth that Disney never did." - <em>The Field</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Patterns of World History: Brief Third Edition, Volume Two from 1400</h2><p><em>Patterns of World History</em>, <strong>Brief Third Edition</strong>, offers a distinct framework for understanding the global past through the study of origins, interactions, and adaptations.

In one sense, their interrelationship is obvious. The first two address a question that was more in the forefront of scholarship a dozen years ago than it is today: the question of differences among religious orders.&nbsp;&nbsp;These two essays set out a method of reading texts for imagery and borrowings as well as for spiritual teaching in order to determine whether individuals who live in different institutional settings hold differing assumptions about the significance of their lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;The essays apply the method to the broader question of differences between regular canons and monks and the narrower question of differences between one kind of monk--the Cistercians--and other religious groups, monastic and nonmonastic, of the twelfth century.&nbsp;&nbsp;The third essay draws on some of the themes of the first two, particularly the discussion of canonical and Cistercian conceptions of the individual brother as example, to suggest &nbsp;an interpretation of twelfth-century religious life as concerned with the nature of groups as well as with affective expression.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth essay, again on Cistercian monks, elaborates themes of the first three. Its subsidiary goals are to provide further evidence on distinctively Cistercian attitudes and to elaborate the Cistercian ambivalence about vocation that I delineate in the essay on conceptions of community. It also raises questions that have now become popular in nonacademic as well as academic circles: what significance should we give to the increase of feminine imagery in twelfth-century religious writing by males? Can we learn anything about distinctively male or female spiritualities from this feminization of language?&nbsp;The fifth essay differs from the others in turning to the thirteenth century rather than the twelfth, to women rather than men, to detailed analysis of many themes in a few thinkers rather than one theme in many writers; it is nonetheless based on the conclusions of the earlier studies. The sense of monastic vocation and of the priesthood, of the authority of God and self, and of the significance of gender that I find in the three great mystics of late thirteenth-century Helfta can be understood only against the background of the growing twelfth- and thirteenth-century concern for evangelism and for an approachable God, which are the basic themes of the first four essays.&nbsp;Such connections between the essays will be clear to anyone who reads them. There are, however, deeper methodological and interpretive continuities among them that I wish to underline here.&nbsp;For these studies constitute a plea for an approach to medieval spirituality that is not now--and perhaps has never been--dominant in medieval scholarship. They also provide an interpretation of the religious life of the high Middle Ages that runs against the grain of recent emphases on the emergence of "lay spirituality." I therefore propose to give, as introduction, both a discussion of recent approaches to medieval piety and a short sketch of the religious history of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, emphasizing those themes that are the context for my specific investigations.&nbsp;I do not want to be misunderstood. In providing here a discussion of approaches to and trends in medieval religion I am not claiming that the studies that follow constitute a general history nor that my method should replace that of social, institutional, and intellectual historians.&nbsp;&nbsp;A handful of Cistercians does not typify the twelfth century, nor three nuns the thirteenth. Religious imagery, on which I concentrate, does not tell us how people lived. But because these essays approach texts in a way others have not done, focus on imagery others have not found important, and insist, as others have not insisted, on comparing groups to other groups (e.g., comparing what is peculiarly male to what is female as well as vice versa), I want to call attention to my approach to and my interpretation of the high Middle Ages in the hope of encouraging others to ask similar questions.</p><p>"During the high Middle Ages many of the devout really did address Jesus as mother and depict their devotion to him in feminine imagery. And not all of these were women . . . . Don't expect a whole volume on this one topic, however . . . . this book contains four other rich and erudite essays on medieval spirituality: one concerning similarities and differences between clerical and monastic spirituality in the 12th century, another on the Cistercian concept of community, a third devoted to the much-debated question of whether the 12th century anticipated the Renaissance in the discovery of the individual, and a fourth explaining the mystical piety of the nuns of Helfta ... in the context of the burgeoning clericalization of the church."--<i>Christian Century</i>&nbsp;"Painstakingly researched and beautifully written. Bynum gives medieval texts a new reading, presents some important women's religious history and, most importantly, gives us a way to compare practices and values of monastic females and males."--<i>Commonweal</i>&nbsp;"First rate and deepens understanding of spirituality as well as of the particular period which Professor Bynum has chosen as her special domain."--<i>Adnos</i>&nbsp;"A collection of careful and serious essays by a discriminating scholar . . . The author has taken care to reconstruct the individual essays so that they form abook of distinction."--<i>Times Literary Supplement</i><b>Caroline Walker Bynum</b> is Western Medieval History, Professor Emerita, School of Historical Studies at the Institute for Advanced Study.</p><h2>Mrs Dalloway (Vintage Classics Woolf Series)</h2><p>In this vivid portrait of one day in a woman&#39;s life, Clarissa Dalloway is preoccupied with the last-minute details of a party she is to give that evening. As she readies her house she is flooded with memories and re-examines the choices she has made over the course of her life.</p><p>Virginia Woolf was born in London in 1882. After her father&#39;s death in 1904 Virginia and her sister, the painter Vanessa Bell, moved to Bloomsbury and became the centre of &#39;The Bloomsbury Group&#39;. This informal collective of artists and writers exerted a powerful influence over early twentieth-century British culture. In 1912 Virginia married Leonard Woolf, a writer and social reformer. Three years later, her first novel The Voyage Out was published, followed by Night and Day (1919) and Jacob&#39;s Room (1922). Between 1925 and 1931 Virginia Woolf produced what are now regarded as her finest masterpieces, from Mrs Dalloway (1925) to The Waves (1931). She also maintained an astonishing output of literary criticism, short fiction, journalism and biography. On 28 March 1941, a few months before the publication of her final novel, Between the Acts, Virginia Woolf committed suicide.&#34;Mrs Dalloway contains some of the most beautiful, complex, incisive and idiosyncratic sentences ever written in English, and that alone would be reason enough to read it. It is one of the most moving, revolutionary artworks of the twentieth century&#34; -- Michael Cunningham, author of The Hours &#34;A beautiful piece of writing&#34; -- Will Self Guardian &#34;I think To The Lighthouse and Mrs Dalloway are sheer magic&#34; -- Eileen Atkins Daily Express &#34;Virginia Woolf was one of the great innovators of that decade of literary Modernism, the 1920s. Novels such as Mrs Dalloway and To the Lighthouse showed how experimental writing could reshape our sense of ordinary life. Taking unremarkable materials - preparations for a genteel party, a day on a bourgeois family holiday - they trace the flow of associations and ideas that we call &#34;consciousness&#34;.&#34; Guardian</p><h2>Literacy for the 21st Century: A Balanced Approach</h2><p>The market leader in literacy education, Literacy for the 21st Century: A Balanced Approach continues to evolve to meet the needs of a changing world.

We made a small patterned book about one of the stuffed animals in the classroom.&nbsp; I wrote some of the words and the students supplied the others, and I duplicated copies of the book for each child.&nbsp; We practiced reading it until everyone memorized our little book.&nbsp; The children proudly took their books home to read to their parents.

The Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History, now celebrating its 150th anniversary, has remade the way we see the world. Delving into the museum&#x2019;s storied and colorful past, award-winning author Richard Conniff introduces a cast of bold explorers, roughneck bone hunters, and visionary scientists. Some became famous for wresting <i>Brontosaurus</i>, <i>Triceratops</i>, and other dinosaurs from the earth, others pioneered the introduction of science education in North America, and still others rediscovered the long-buried glory of Machu Picchu.<br> &nbsp;<br> In this lively tale of events, achievements, and scandals from throughout the museum&#x2019;s history. Readers will encounter renowned paleontologist O. C. Marsh who engaged in ferocious combat with his &#x201c;Bone Wars&#x201d; rival Edward Drinker Cope, as well as dozens of other intriguing characters. Nearly 100 color images portray important figures in the Peabody&#x2019;s history and special objects from the museum&#x2019;s 13-million-item collections. For anyone with an interest in exploring, understanding, and protecting the natural world, this book will deliver abundant delights.</p><p><b>What do you hope readers will learn from their encounter with your book?</b><br> I want readers to come away feeling that this is a ripping good yarn of exploration, with big engaging characters taking enormous risks and bringing back great discoveries that make us think in new ways about the world.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>If you were to embark on an expedition with one of the scientists you discuss, who would that be?</b><br> It would be the 1870 expedition by paleontologist O. C. Marsh and a dozen Yale students into an American West that was still wild, still home to millions of bison, still under the control of Native American tribes. That expedition launched Marsh&#x2019;s remarkable career, bringing to life unimaginable creatures from lost worlds. And it opened the eyes of a bottom-of-the-class Yale graduate named George Bird Grinnell, who went on to become one of the most influential figures in the American conservation movement, a savior of the bison, and an anthropologist of vanishing tribal cultures.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Which scientists intrigued or surprised you the most?</b><br> James Dwight Dana and his poignant struggle to reconcile his commitment to science with his deep religious faith. Dana was among the first people to whom Darwin confided about his work on the theory of evolution by natural selection. (&#x201c;I groan when I make such a confession,&#x201d; he wrote to Dana.) Dana&#x2019;s struggle took place as the scientists of the Peabody Museum were delivering to his doorstep convincing fossil evidence.<b>Richard Conniff </b>is a prize-winning science writer and journalist and the author of nine books including <i>The Species Seekers: Heroes, Fools, and the Mad Pursuit of Life on Earth</i><i>.</i> He lives in Old Lyme, CT.</p><h2>Art Before Breakfast: The Workbook</h2><p>Based upon the bestselling book by beloved author and artist Danny Gregory, this encouraging guided journal is packed with short exercises designed to help shape a life-enriching artistic habit.

She draws heavily on developmental, interpersonal, family systems, and self-psychological schools of thought and integrates the core components of all of these approaches in a clear and concise manner. She stresses the need for intensive assessment to precede conceptualization and treatment planning so that treatment techniques are dictated by the needs of each child and family. Brems has contoured the third edition to meet the practical needs and expectations of students and practitioners. Divided among four sections, the chapters follow the logical development of clinicians, mirroring the natural flow of work with children--from the practitioner's self-exploration, to learning about special aspects of children (such as diversity and development), to awareness about the special needs and demands of children as related to environmental, legal, and ethical issues. Brems prepares clinicians to discover their own personal traits that may facilitate or hinder their work with children. She walks child therapists and counselors through the initial stages of intake, assessment, and conceptualization. The material on assessment instruments is thoroughly updated; discussions refer to the latest versions of instruments, and if new instruments emerged that meet one of the purposes deemed essential to child treatment, they are included. The text contains case examples, each illustrating a specific therapeutic technique.<p> Titles of related interest also from Waveland Press: Todd-Bohart, <i>Foundations of Clinical and Counseling Psychology,</i> Fourth Edition (ISBN 9781577664109) and Wohlfarth-Morgan, <i>Case Studies in Child and Adolescent Psychopathology,</i> Second Edition (ISBN 9781478626633).</p></p><p></p><h2>The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today (Meridian Classic)</h2><p>First published in 1873, <b>The Gilded Age</b> is both a biting satire and a revealing portrait of post-Civil War America-an age of corruption when crooked land speculators, ruthless bankers, and dishonest politicians voraciously took advantage of the nation's peacetime optimism. With his characteristic wit and perception, Mark Twain and his collaborator, Charles Dudley Warner, attack the greed, lust, and naivete of their own time in a work which endures as a valuable social document and one of America's most important satirical novels.</p><p><strong>Mark Twain</strong> was born Samuel Langhorne Clemens in Florida, Missouri, in 1835, and died at Redding, Connecticut in 1910. In his person and in his pursuits he was a man of extraordinary contrasts. Although he left school at twelve when his father died, he was eventually awarded honorary degrees from Yale University, the University of Missouri, and Oxford University. His career encompassed such varied occupations as printer, Mississippi riverboat pilot, journalist, travel writer, and publisher. He made fortunes from his writing but toward the end of his life he had to resort to lecture tours to pay his debts. He was hot-tempered, profane, and sentimental<b></b>and also pessimistic, cynical, and tortured by self-doubt. His nostalgia helped produce some of his best books. He lives in American letters as a great artist, the writer whom William Dean Howells called the Lincoln of our literature.Chapter 1 Nibiwa win o-dibendan aki.1<br><br> Eng. A gallant tract<br><br> Of land it is!<br><br> Meercraft. &#x2019;Twill yield a pound an acre:<br><br> We must let cheap ever at first. But, sir,<br><br> This looks too large for you, I see.<br><br> June, 18&#x2014;. Squire Hawkins sat upon the pyramid of large blocks, called the &#x201c;stile,&#x201d; in front of his house, contemplating the morning.<br><br> The locality was Obedstown, East Tennessee. You would not know that Obedstown stood on the top of a mountain, for there was nothing about the landscape to indicate it&#x2014;but it did: a mountain that stretched abroad over whole counties, and rose very gradually. The district was called the &#x201c;Knobs of East Tennessee,&#x201d; and had a reputation like Nazareth,2 as far as turning out any good thing was concerned.<br><br> The Squire&#x2019;s house was a double log cabin, in a state of decay; two or three gaunt hounds lay asleep about the threshold, and lifted their heads sadly whenever Mrs. Hawkins or the children stepped in and out over their bodies. Rubbish was scattered about the grassless yard; a bench stood near the door with a tin wash basin on it and a pail of water and a gourd; a cat had begun to drink from the pail, but the exertion was overtaxing her energies, and she had stopped to rest. There was an ash-hopper by the fence, and an iron pot, for soft-soap-boiling, near it.<br><br> This dwelling constituted one-fifteenth of Obedstown; the other fourteen houses were scattered about among the tall pine trees and among the corn-fields in such a way that a man might stand in the midst of the city and not know but that he was in the country if he only depended on his eyes for information.<br><br> &#x201c;Squire&#x201d; Hawkins got his title from being postmaster of Obedstown&#x2014;not that the title properly belonged to the office, but because in those regions the chief citizens always must have titles of some sort, and so the usual courtesy had been extended to Hawkins. The mail was monthly, and sometimes amounted to as much as three or four letters at a single delivery. Even a rush like this did not fill up the postmaster&#x2019;s whole month, though, and therefore he &#x201c;kept store&#x201d; in the intervals.<br><br> The Squire was contemplating the morning. It was balmy and tranquil, the vagrant breezes were laden with the odor of flowers, the murmur of bees was in the air, there was everywhere that suggestion of repose that summer woodlands bring to the senses, and the vague, pleasurable melancholy that such a time and such surroundings inspire.<br><br> Presently the United States mail arrived, on horseback. There was but one letter, and it was for the postmaster. The long-legged youth who carried the mail tarried an hour to talk, for there was no hurry; and in a little while the male population of the village had assembled to help. As a general thing, they were dressed in homespun &#x201c;jeans,&#x201d; blue or yellow&#x2014;there were no other varieties of it; all wore one suspender and sometimes two&#x2014;yarn ones knitted at home,&#x2014;some wore vests, but few wore coats. Such coats and vests as did appear, however, were rather picturesque than otherwise, for they were made of tolerably fanciful patterns of calico&#x2014;a fashion which prevails there to this day among those of the community who have tastes above the common level and are able to afford style. Every individual arrived with his hands in his pockets; a hand came out occasionally for a purpose, but it always went back again after service; and if it was the head that was served, just the cant that the dilapidated straw hat got by being uplifted and rooted under, was retained until the next call altered the inclination; many hats were present, but none were erect and no two were canted just alike. We are speaking impartially of men, youths and boys. And we are also speaking of these three estates when we say that every individual was either chewing natural leaf tobacco prepared on his own premises, or smoking the same in a corn-cob pipe. Few of the men wore whiskers; none wore moustaches; some had a thick jungle of hair under the chin and hiding the throat&#x2014;the only pattern recognized there as being the correct thing in whiskers; but no part of any individual&#x2019;s face had seen a razor for a week.<br><br> These neighbors stood a few moments looking at the mail carrier reflectively while he talked; but fatigue soon began to show itself, and one after another they climbed up and occupied the top rail of the fence, hump-shouldered and grave, like a company of buzzards assembled for supper and listening for the death-rattle. Old Damrell said:<br><br> &#x201c;Tha hain&#x2019;t no news &#x2019;bout the jedge, hit ain&#x2019;t likely?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Cain&#x2019;t tell for sartin; some thinks he&#x2019;s gwyne to be &#x2019;long toreckly, and some thinks &#x2019;e hain&#x2019;t. Russ Mosely he tole ole Hanks he mought git to Obeds tomorrer or nex&#x2019; day he reckoned.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Well, I wisht I knowed. I got a prime sow and pigs in the cote-house,3 and I hain&#x2019;t got no place for to put &#x2019;em. If the jedge is a gwyne to hold cote, I got to roust &#x2019;em out, I reckon. But tomorrer&#x2019;ll do, I &#x2019;spect.&#x201d;<br><br> The speaker bunched his thick lips together like the stem-end of a tomato and shot a bumble-bee dead that had lit on a weed seven feet away. One after another the several chewers expressed a charge of tobacco juice and delivered it at the deceased with steady aim and faultless accuracy.<br><br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s a stirrin&#x2019;, down &#x2019;bout the Forks?&#x201d; continued Old Damrell.<br><br> &#x201c;Well, I dunno, skasely. Ole Drake Higgins he&#x2019;s ben down to Shelby las&#x2019; week. Tuck his crap down; couldn&#x2019;t git shet o&#x2019; the most uv it; hit warn&#x2019;t no time for to sell, he say, so he fotch it back agin, &#x2019;lowin&#x2019; to wait tell fall. Talks &#x2019;bout goin&#x2019; to Mozouri&#x2014;lots uv &#x2019;ems talkin&#x2019; that-away down thar, Ole Higgins say. Cain&#x2019;t make a livin&#x2019; here no mo&#x2019;, sich times as these. Si Higgins he&#x2019;s ben over to Kaintuck n&#x2019; married a high-toned gal thar, outen the fust families, an&#x2019; he&#x2019;s come back to the Forks with jist a hell&#x2019;s-mint o&#x2019; whoop-jamboree notions, folks says. He&#x2019;s tuck an&#x2019; fixed up the ole house like they does in Kaintuck, he say, an&#x2019; tha&#x2019;s ben folks come cler from Turpentine for to see it. He&#x2019;s tuck an&#x2019; gawmed it all over on the inside with plarsterin&#x2019;.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s plarsterin&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I dono. Hit&#x2019;s what he calls it. Ole Mam Higgins, she tole me. She say she warn&#x2019;t gwyne to hang out in no sich a dern hole like a hog. Says it&#x2019;s mud, or some sich kind o&#x2019; nastness that sticks on n&#x2019; kivers up everything. Plarsterin&#x2019;, Si calls it.&#x201d;<br><br> This marvel was discussed at considerable length; and almost with animation. But presently there was a dog-fight over in the neighborhood of the blacksmith shop, and the visitors slid off their perch like so many turtles and strode to the battle-field with an interest bordering on eagerness. The Squire remained, and read his letter. Then he sighed, and sat long in meditation. At intervals he said:<br><br> &#x201c;Missouri. Missouri. Well, well, well, everything is so uncertain.&#x201d;<br><br> At last he said:<br><br> &#x201c;I believe I&#x2019;ll do it.&#x2014;A man will just rot, here. My house, my yard, everything around me, in fact, shows that I am becoming one of these cattle&#x2014;and I used to be thrifty in other times.&#x201d;<br><br> He was not more than thirty-five, but he had a worn look that made him seem older. He left the stile, entered that part of his house which was the store, traded a quart of thick molasses for a coonskin and a cake of beeswax to an old dame in linsey-woolsey,4 put his letter away, and went into the kitchen. His wife was there, constructing some dried apple pies; a slovenly urchin of ten was dreaming over a rude weather-vane of his own contriving; his small sister, close upon four years of age, was sopping corn-bread in some gravy left in the bottom of a frying-pan and trying hard not to sop over a finger-mark that divided the pan through the middle&#x2014;for the other side belonged to the brother, whose musings made him forget his stomach for the moment; a negro woman was busy cooking, at a vast fire-place. Shiftlessness and poverty reigned in the place.<br><br> &#x201c;Nancy, I&#x2019;ve made up my mind. The world is done with me, and perhaps I ought to be done with it. But no matter&#x2014;I can wait. I am going to Missouri. I won&#x2019;t stay in this dead country and decay with it. I&#x2019;ve had it on my mind some time. I&#x2019;m going to sell out here for whatever I can get, and buy a wagon and team and put you and the children in it and start.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Anywhere that suits you, suits me, Si. And the children can&#x2019;t be any worse off in Missouri than they are here, I reckon.&#x201d;<br><br> Motioning his wife to a private conference in their own room, Hawkins said: &#x201c;No, they&#x2019;ll be better off. I&#x2019;ve looked out for them, Nancy,&#x201d; and his face lighted. &#x201c;Do you see these papers? Well, they are evidence that I have taken up Seventy-five Thousand Acres of Land in this county&#x2014;think what an enormous fortune it will be some day! Why, Nancy, enormous don&#x2019;t express it&#x2014;the word&#x2019;s too tame! I tell you, Nancy&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;For goodness sake, Si&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Wait, Nancy, wait&#x2014;let me finish&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve been secretly boiling and fuming with this grand inspiration for weeks, and I must talk or I&#x2019;ll burst! I haven&#x2019;t whispered to a soul&#x2014;not a word&#x2014;have had my countenance under lock and key, for fear it might drop something that would tell even these animals here how to discern the gold mine that&#x2019;s glaring under their noses. Now all that is necessary to hold this land and keep it in the family is to pay the trifling taxes on it yearly&#x2014;five or ten dollars&#x2014;the whole tract would not sell for over a third of a cent an acre now, but some day people will be glad to get it for twenty dollars, fifty dollars, a hundred dollars an acre! What should you say to&#x201d; [here he dropped his voice to a whisper and looked anxiously around to see that there were no eavesdroppers,] &#x201c;a thousand dollars an acre!<br><br> &#x201c;Well you may open your eyes and stare! But it&#x2019;s so. You and I may not see the day, but they&#x2019;ll see it. Mind I tell you, they&#x2019;ll see it. Nancy, you&#x2019;ve heard of steamboats, and may be you believed in them&#x2014;of course you did. You&#x2019;ve heard these cattle here scoff at them and call them lies and humbugs,&#x2014;but they&#x2019;re not lies and humbugs, they&#x2019;re a reality and they&#x2019;re going to be a more wonderful thing some day than they are now. They&#x2019;re going to make a revolution in this world&#x2019;s affairs that will make men dizzy to contemplate. I&#x2019;ve been watching&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve been watching while some people slept, and I know what&#x2019;s coming.<br><br> &#x201c;Even you and I will see the day that steamboats will come up that little Turkey river to within twenty miles of this land of ours&#x2014;and in high water they&#x2019;ll come right to it! And this is not all, Nancy&#x2014;it isn&#x2019;t even half! There&#x2019;s a bigger wonder&#x2014;the railroad! These worms here have never even heard of it&#x2014;and when they do they&#x2019;ll not believe in it. But it&#x2019;s another fact. Coaches that fly over the ground twenty miles an hour&#x2014;heavens and earth, think of that, Nancy! Twenty miles an hour. It makes a man&#x2019;s brain whirl. Some day, when you and I are in our graves, there&#x2019;ll be a railroad stretching hundreds of miles&#x2014;all the way down from the cities of the Northern States to New Orleans&#x2014;and its got to run within thirty miles of this land&#x2014;may be even touch a corner of it. Well, do you know, they&#x2019;ve quit burning wood in some places in the Eastern States? And what do you suppose they burn? Coal!&#x201d; [He bent over and whispered again:] &#x201c;There&#x2019;s whole worlds of it on this land! You know that black stuff that crops out of the bank of the branch?&#x2014;well, that&#x2019;s it. You&#x2019;ve taken it for rocks; so has every body here; and they&#x2019;ve built little dams and such things with it. One man was going to build a chimney out of it. Nancy I expect I turned as white as a sheet! Why, it might have caught fire and told everything. I showed him it was too crumbly. Then he was going to build it of copper ore&#x2014;splendid yellow forty-per-cent. ore! There&#x2019;s fortunes upon fortunes of copper ore on our land! It scared me to death, the idea of this fool starting a smelting furnace in his house without knowing it, and getting his dull eyes opened. And then he was going to build it of iron ore! There&#x2019;s mountains of iron ore here, Nancy&#x2014;whole mountains of it. I wouldn&#x2019;t take any chances. I just stuck by him&#x2014;I haunted him&#x2014;I never let him alone till he built it of mud and sticks like all the rest of the chimneys in this dismal country. Pine forests, wheat land, corn land, iron, copper, coal&#x2014;wait till the railroads come, and the steamboats! We&#x2019;ll never see the day, Nancy&#x2014;never in the world&#x2014;never, never, never, child. We&#x2019;ve got to drag along, drag along, and eat crusts in toil and poverty, all hopeless and forlorn&#x2014;but they&#x2019;ll ride in coaches, Nancy! They&#x2019;ll live like the princes of the earth; they&#x2019;ll be courted and worshiped; their names will be known from ocean to ocean! Ah, well-a-day! Will they ever come back here, on the railroad and the steamboat, and say &#x2018;This one little spot shall not be touched&#x2014;this hovel shall be sacred&#x2014;for here our father and our mother suffered for us, thought for us, laid the foundations of our future as solid as the hills!&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You are a great, good, noble soul, Si Hawkins, and I am an honored woman to be the wife of such a man&#x201d;&#x2014;and the tears stood in her eyes when she said it. &#x201c;We will go to Missouri. You are out of your place, here, among these groping dumb creatures. We will find a higher place, where you can walk with your own kind, and be understood when you speak&#x2014;not stared at as if you were talking some foreign tongue. I would go anywhere, anywhere in the wide world with you. I would rather my body should starve and die than your mind should hunger and wither away in this lonely land.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Spoken like yourself, my child!

His writings cover literature, art history and his own struggle to be a painter, various sciences and political events, personal encounters, and the Italian landscape. "In Rome," Goethe wrote, "I first found myself, for the first time I achieved inner harmony...." For Goethe the writer, this temporal and spiritual journey was at the root of his development from <i>Sturm und Drang</i> to classicism, a decisive point in his life and the history of German literature.</p></p><p><b>Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</b> was born in Frankfurt-on-Main in 1749. He studied at Leipzig, where he showed interest in the occult, and at Strassburg, where Herder introduced him to Shakespeare&#x2019;s works and to folk poetry. He produced some essays and lyrical verse, and at twenty-two wrote <b>G�tz von Berlichingen</b>, a play which brought him national fame and established him in the current Sturm und Drang movement. This was followed by the novel <b>The Sorrows of Young Werther</b> in 1774, which was an even greater success.<p>Goethe began work on <b>Faust</b>, and <b>Egmont</b>, another tragedy before being invited to join the government of Weimar. His interest in the classical world led him to leave suddenly for Italy in 1786 and the Italian Journey recounts his travels there. <b>Iphigenia in Tauris</b> and <b>Torquato Tasso</b>, classical dramas, were written at this time. Returning to Weimar, Goethe started the second part of <b>Faust</b>, encouraged by Schiller. In 1806 he married Christiane Vulpius. During this late period he finished his series of Wilhelm Master books and wrote many other works, including <b>The Oriental Divan</b> (1819). He also directed the State Theatre and worked on scientific theories in evolutionary botany, anatomy and color. Goethe completed <b>Faust</b> in 1832, just before he died.<br><b>W.H. Auden</b> was born in 1907 and went to Oxford University, where he became Professor of Poetry from 1956 to 1960. After the publication of his <b>Poems</b> in 1930, he became the acknowledged leader of the 'thirties poets'. His poetic output was prolific, and he also wrote verse plays in collaboration with Christopher Isherwood, with whom he visited china. In 1946 he became a U.S. citizen. He died in 1973.<br><b>Elizabeth Mayer</b> was born in Mecklengurg in 1884 and emigrated to the U.S. in 1936.

I also wanted to share the experience of growing up in a family of good cooks where food was an expression of love and caring.... Many dishes from Abruzzo, such as maccheroni alla chitarra ("guitar" macaroni), brodetto di pesce (fish stew), and porchetta (roast pig), have, of course, traveled. But most of them are still the treasured secrets of families. They travel no further than the next generation.... My family gave me a passion for food. The rituals that were practiced in my grandmother's kitchen are still with me. All this has remained part of my life, and cooking for family and friends is a constant joy for me. To celebrate and make people happy are the reasons why I wrote this book."<p>Praise for Anna Teresa Callen's Menus for Pasta:<br>"A culinary gem for everyone who wants to bring the true flavor of Italy into their home." ?Paula Wolfert, author of <i>Mediterranean Grains and Greens</i></p><p>"Of course one can eat pasta as a main course. It is how my mother would serve us pasta every Wednesday and Sunday when I was a boy. And this wonderful evocative book richly demonstrates that pasta can indeed be the centerpiece of an elegant meal. Bravo pasta, brava Anna Teresa!" ?Fred Feretti, columnist for <i>Gourmet</i> magazine</p></p><p><i>Forte e Gentile</i>, strong and gentle, is the motto of Abruzzo, the Italian province east of Rome that stretches from the towering Apennine Mountains to the Adriatic Sea. Anna Teresa Callen, in <i>Food and Memories of Abruzzo</i>, is most engaging as she shares stories of her life and presents the varied food of this little-known part of Italy where she grew up and still spends much of her time. Callen composes a symphony of sounds and aromas to surround the recipes in this memoir-cum-cookbook, describing how her grandmother, cutting pasta for pastina "into tiny dots, made a tic-tac sound with her knife," and recounting how the "pungent smell of coffee wafting from the kitchen" woke her from her daily summer siesta. Old photos from family albums add to Callen's vivid memories.<p> Using Callen's recipes, you can recreate <i>Maccheroni alla Chitarra</i>, the Abruzzese "square spaghetti" some Italian restaurants in the U.S. and elsewhere now serve, and robust <i>Porchetta</i>, sublimely succulent spit-roasted pork served with its crackling, mahogany skin, as well as the colorful fish stew <i>Brodetto di Pesce</i>, which her father used to make, and L'sagne, a flour-and-water pasta unique to Abruzzo. In a balancing act, Callen gives recipes for simple dishes perfect for today's cooks along with more complicated regional specialties and spectacular holiday dishes. Her guidance for making <i>La Cicerchiata</i>, an ancient dessert made for Mardi Gras by assembling honey-soaked "chick peas" of fried dough, whole almonds, and candied fruit into a colorful ring, is as clear as her directions for <i>Mozzarella all'Erbette</i>, a combination of sliced cheese dressed with a puree of fresh herbs and capers that can be put together in minutes.</p><p> Callen crams this book with basic culinary advice and a wealth of information about the Italian kitchen, demystifying the differences between salsa, sugo, and ragu, for example, and advising how to make smooth polenta using cold liquid. In all, this is an exceptional volume for cooks, Italophiles, and anyone who likes a good story. <i>--Dana Jacobi</i></p>Nestled between the Adriatic Sea and the majestic Apennine Mountains, Abruzzo is one of Italy's most striking regions. A land of colorful festivals, brooding traditions, gargantuan banquets, and ancient superstitions, Abruzzo's cultural riches are rivaled only by its culinary ones. This is Italy's "pastoral land," where the simple flavors of the earth and sea create a food of abundant ingredients and vibrant flavors. Esteemed author and cooking teacher Anna Teresa Callen grew up in Abruzzo and still cooks its regional specialties&#x2014;the honest food that reflects Abruzzo's rustic environment. From the heartland comes the food of the farmers: wholesome and flavorful poultry dishes, succulent roasts, and robust vegetable preparations. From the mountains come the lamb dishes that are the toast of Italy, and from the sea comes the food of the fishermen: zesty brodetti (fish stews) and grigliate (grilled fish). This is simple cooking at its best, with flavors kept fresh and clean. Yet the Abruzzesi are famous for their elaborate festival dishes as much as for their rustic fare. Celebration food is eagerly awaited on special occasions to welcome guests and delight family and friends. Good examples are the stunning timballi, served at birthdays, and Maccheroni alla Chitarra&#x2014;an unusual pasta made on a stringed instrument resembling a guitar&#x2014;the signature dish of the region, the one that traditionally greets travelers with its distinctive presentation and tempting flavor. There is good reason that the people of rugged Abruzzo are renowned for their hospitality. Their motto is "Abruzzo, forte e gentile"&#x2014;"Abruzzo, strong and kind." For many years Abruzzo's mountain curtain separated the region from mainstream Italy, creating a unique cuisine. Most dishes have remained the treasured secrets of the families who have passed them down through the generations. This robust home cooking is unveiled for the first time in Food and Memories of Abruzzo. Here is the Cardoon Soup that Anna Teresa's grandmother cooked at Christmas as tradition commands; Fiadone Villese, a savory pie that is an Easter tradition; and La Cicerchiata, an ancient dessert descended from Jews living in Italy. The author's experience as a cooking teacher, which she expertly communicates to her readers, is evident in these recipes. She offers more than readers need to know to ensure that her dishes will be perfectly executed and that home cooks will be delighted by the results of everything they cook. The best example of this is her chapter on fresh pasta making, whose intricacies are illuminated by Callen's precise text. Her understanding of modern health concerns is evident as well. These recipes contain a minimum of fat and salt, and emphasize fresh ingredients for flavor, as the vegetable and salads chapters in particular attest. Amid the tempting recipes are the author's recollections of her bucolic girlhood in the town of Guardiagrele. Callen's vivid memories of fishing with her father in the Adriatic, hunting for mushrooms in the forests, and rolling out pasta by hand with her mother&#x2014;as well as a sampling of her family photos&#x2014;immerse her readers in the patterns of daily life in Abruzzo. The power of Abruzzo's beauty and charm radiates from every page of this landmark cookbook. But as absorbing as the region's legends and the author's memories are, it is the recipes that offer true revelations. The recipes in this book are for the food and land Callen returns to again and again&#x2014;both in her mind and in person. They are recipes whose robust tastes will linger, continuing to lure you into the kitchen to create the joy and abundance of Italy's pastoral land at home.</p><h2>Psychodynamic Psychiatry in Clinical Practice (4th Edition)</h2><p><p>This new edition of the classic psychodynamic psychiatry text, Psychodynamic Psychiatry in Clinical Practice, continues its tradition as the most readable, scholarly, and practical introduction to psychodynamic theory and practice available. Kept within arm's reach of all mental health professionals, this invaluable "one-stop" reference will prepare you to teach students and treat patients more effectively with its truly integrative psychodynamic approach.</p><p>The author has meticulously updated every chapter of the previous edition, adding new illustrative case examples and discussing the most recent research findings and concepts in psychodynamic psychiatry. It introduces the basic principles of psychodynamic psychiatry and the four fundamental theoretical frameworks derived from psychoanalytic theory: ego psychology, object relations theory, self psychology, and attachment theory. Drawing on the latest breakthroughs in neuroscience to validate the latest psychodynamic thinking, the author includes neuroanatomical illustrations that highlight the need to integrate psychoanalytic theories of development with brain development and the impact of environment on gene expression.</p><p>The eminently practical Psychodynamic Psychiatry in Clinical Practice is organized into three distinct sections based on DSM-IV diagnoses: ? Section I, Basic Principles and Treatment Approaches in Dynamic Psychiatry, begins by laying a foundation in psychoanalytic theory. It focuses on how to apply psychoanalytic theory to specific types of evaluation and treatment, including psychodynamic assessment, brief therapy, individual and group psychotherapy, family and marital therapy, pharmacotherapy, and hospital/partial hospital treatment.? Section II, Dynamic Approaches to Axis I Disorders, covers the major psychiatric disorders and discusses how to apply psychodynamic understanding to the treatment of patients with these disorders.? Section III, Dynamic Approaches to Axis II Disorders, provides a psychodynamic understanding of personality disorders and covers in detail the principles of psychodynamic psychotherapy for these conditions. </p><p>The fourth edition of Psychodynamic Psychiatry in Clinical Practice details the theory of psychodynamic psychotherapy and the adaptation of psychodynamic thinking to specific disorders. As such, it is an ideal companion to Dr. Gabbard's Long-Term Psychodynamic Psychotherapy: A Basic Text, which details the techniques of dynamic psychotherapy. </p><p>The bestselling Psychodynamic Psychiatry in Clinical Practice is the definitive reference for training programs of all kinds at all levels. This new edition provides a clear synthesis of diagnostic understanding and treatment unmatched in the literature. Marked by Dr. Gabbard's distinctly lucid and compelling prose, it is the ultimate psychiatric guide for the busy clinician and mental health student.</p></p><p><p>Glen O. Gabbard, M.D., Brown Foundation Chair of Psychoanalysis and Professor, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, and Director, Baylor Psychiatric Clinic, Baylor College of Medicine; Training and Supervising Analyst, Houston-Galveston Psychoanalytic Institute, Houston, Texas.</p>&#34;This new edition continues the trend towards integration of data from neuroscience research started in the last version. A burgeoning field of neuropsychoanalysis has sprung up in recent years, and the findings of neuroscientists and those who examine the interaction between genes and environment are confirming psychoanalytic views of development and the mechanisms of the mind. In this edition I have sought to weave those findings into the fabric of the first and second chapters that establish the basic principles and theoretical foundations of dynamic psychiatry. In so doing, I am once again asserting that psychodynamic psychiatrists must situate themselves firmly in a biopsychosocial context that recognizes the need to incorporate the findings of biological psychiatry into our theories about the human mind. Psychoanalytic theories of development, for example, can no longer stand apart from what we know about brain development and the impact of the environment on gene expression.&#34; - From the Preface&#34;</p>
